But here's my question: isn't the way that film is exposed by the rotating shutter in a motion picture camera similar to that of a CMOS sensor with a rolling shutter? So why, with the same shutter speed and sensor/film size, would a CMOS sensor camera have rolling shutter effects while a film camera recording the same thing (say a fan or helicopter blades) would not?

And while on the topic, I'm wondering what used to be required when film cameras shot scenes with TVs in the frame. Was it simply a matter of changing the shutter angle to equate with a shutter speed of 1/60? And even in that situation, since the frame rate of a film camera is 24 but the refresh rate of a CRT is 60, wouldn't some frames show an empty screen while others would show an image due to the fact that the frame rate doesn't match the refresh rate of the TV? I"m a little confused.
 
The analogy used regarding film by digital camera manufacturers is that there is an extremely high refresh rate on film and by increasing this on their latest CMOS cameras RED and ARRI the jello cam effect is gone or reduced to levels that aren't noticeable. Most CMOS cameras don't have or with DSLR don't normally require these higher refresh rates to take stills. However, that's not to say you won't get part exposed areas within a frame when using a high speed strobe or flash light.
 
The truth is that film shutters do cause some mild rolling shutter artifacts, but because the sweep of the shutter is so fast, it's pretty minimal. Rolling shutters in digital cameras can reduce the problem by increasing the read-out speed / shortening the read-out time of the CMOS sensor.
 
If you are talking about shooting LCD screens, the decay time of the pixels in the monitor is long enough, and the refresh rate high enough, that a 24 fps movie camera does not need to be synced to the monitor. It's a little like shooting a Kinoflo or something.
 
With Plasma TV's, there can be a bit of an AC pulse visible and you'd have to play with the shutter speed on the video camera to get rid of it. For a film camera, I'd try a 144 degree shutter angle for starters but the truth is that not all Plasma screens run at the same refresh rate of 60 Hz. But it's a mild pulse.
 
With CRT computer screens, it's very hard to shoot them with a 24 fps camera because they run at all sorts of frame rates. You'd have to get into the computer and change the refresh rate to something shootable. For movies avoided the problem by sticking CRT TV sets in the computer housing and running video playback through it, or sticking an LCD screen inside the CRT housing and not dealing with sync at all.

If you changed the frame rate of the camera to 29.97 fps the roll bar would stop moving/rolling, and if you used a sync/phase box, you could phase/move the line out of the picture. Truth is that you could leave the shutter angle at 180 degrees in this case and phase the bar out of the picture.
 
If you used a 144 degree shutter angle (for a thinner roll bar) and changed the frame rate of the camera to 23.976 fps the thin roll bar would now stop moving/rolling... but you'd actually see two thin lines, and with the phase box, you could move them until either you had only one line visible in the center of the screen, or two lines, each at the top third of the screen. But you couldn't get rid of the lines unless you shot at 29.97 fps instead of 23.976 fps.
 
At that point, your option was to hire a 24fps video playback company. They would bring a 24fps TV set to the shoot -- 23.976 fps actually -- and a 23.976 fps betacam deck and any video footage you wanted for playback converted by them from 59.94i to 23.976 fps.
 
....so the 'famous' Wes Anderson film camera moves will not give you the horrible skew effect you see in digital cameras on a film camera then right? Im wondering whether this will happen on my 180 degree shutter Aaton XTR 16mm
 
You may get a "strobe" effect from panning too fast, but the film cameras tend to have a softer wiping motion from the mechanical shutter, so any rolling shutter tends not to be noticeable in practice. I've done shots on an Aaton which would drive rolling shutter digital cameras crazy without having any noticeable skew on the Aaton.
 
When I shoot slow/fast motion on digital, I change the shutter speed to maintain the same motion blur as for the 'normal' speed, i.e. shooting on 25p, 1/50 'normally' and then do 50p for instance, I shoot at 1/100 to have the same amount motion blur. Assuming you **want** the same motion blur, how would you do this shooting on film?
 
I am right in understanding that 180 degree shutter angle will remain 180 regardless of what frame rate you shoot? I.e. shooting 25fps and 50fps means that the shutter turns twice as fast to maintain 180 degree shutter angle? I hadn't noticed but was told that Red has an option for shutter to have either a shutter speed (1/xxxx) or angle (degrees), does this mean **if** you want to shoot everything at 180 degrees, you don't have to keep changing the angle for different fps?
 
But surely, even if you can capture everything at 180 degrees, in playback, there will be variations of motion blur as the angle **was relative to the fps**? I.e. 25fps has 180 degrees and 50p has 180 degrees, but **compared to each other**, they don't match?
 
The shutter time / speed -- which controls the amount of motion blur per frame -- is the result of the combination of frame rate and shutter angle. So if the frame rates are different and the shutter angle is the same, then the shutter times will still be different.
 
The shutter is a spinning metal disk in front of the film with a pie slice hole cut out to let light pass through, so the shutter angle is a measurement of that gap or hole -- 180 degrees means it's a half-circle, half open, since 180 is half of 360. So the shutter is open for half the time that the frame rate allows. If the camera is taking a new picture 24 times a second, then the shutter is open for 1/48th of a second.
 
25 fps and 50 fps are easy to calculate the difference in exposure time at 180 degrees, it would be 1/50th and 1/100th, but there is no way to shoot at 1/50th at 50 fps because you'd need a 360 degree shutter angle, i.e. no shutter at all, but you can easily get 25 fps to be 1/100th just by switching to a 90 degree shutter angle.
 
If you want a 180 degree shutter angle, you set the camera to that -- it won't change as the frame rate changes unless you've got some fancy 35mm camera that can do speed ramps where the exposure stays the same as the speed changes by changing the shutter angle instead of the f-stop. In that case, you could ramp from 25 fps to 50 fps and the camera would change the shutter angle from 90 degrees to 180 degrees to keep the exposure consistent.
 
The Red camera is tricky because there is some setting called "relative" which I think can change the shutter time or angle to something other than what you set, I'm not sure. In theory, yes, you use use shutter time or angle, so that if you use angle, the time will change with the frame rate.
 
So with regard to your motion blur question, the answer is no, the amount of motion blur will not be the same when shooting at different frame rates with a film camera. 

As you increase the frame rate, the exposure time decreases, so the amount of motion blur also decreases.
 
So, a follow-up question - When shooting film, do you just have to settle for very little motion blur, if you shoot at 120fps, for instance (5 times less the amount of 24p motion blur at 180 degrees)? Or is this something you wouldn't even care aesthetically as it's slow motion?
 
But when you under-crank, you should be able to match the motion blur as long as you adjust the shutter angle to match exposure time of 24/25fps, i.e. 24fps at 180 degrees = 12fps at 90 degrees? And as an artistic choice, you could shoot at, say 1fps at 180 degrees and have a lot ton of motion blur (providing you expose correctly)?
 
It actually looks odd if you open up the shutter on high speed shots, like using a digital camera running at 60P with 1/60th of a second (360 degree shutter), even though in theory that's the same motion blur PER FRAME as something shot at 30P with a 1/60th shutter time (180 degree shutter) -- keep in mind that you are watching the high frame rate shot played back at something like 24 fps, so the motion is unique, being slowed. If it is blurrier on top of being slower, it looks sort of smeary, dreamy.
