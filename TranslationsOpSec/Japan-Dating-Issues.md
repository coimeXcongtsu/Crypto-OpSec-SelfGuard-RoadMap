The first topic we agreed to write about is dating. Specifically, dating Japanese people in Japan. Kayo wrote her piece from the perspective of an outgoing, independent, and overall badass Japanese lady. Be sure to check it out here.
 
Then there is language. Japanese language is extremely high context, and the level of mastery you need for a healthy, fulfilling relationship goes far beyond what you need with friends or for business.

Naturally, people who feel exhausted with their lives in Japan figure the grass must be greener at the chalet. Usually you can tell when during the first few dates, your romantic interest asks you how long before you plan to go home, and how wonderful it must be to live abroad.
 
The most famous is the go-kon (合コン), which is basically a group first date. Many Japanese people are nervous of just meeting one-on-one, so instead they meet two-on-two, or three-on-three. A group of single ladies will meet with a group of single men, and couples will be formed.
 
I was also surprised by how many couples are formed within companies. Japanese employment is usually for life, so the company can be a second family. When you spend most of your time with colleagues, romance will naturally ensue.
 
Sadly, sometimes declarations fail. If she friendzones you, tough luck. On the bright side, you get to use one of my favorite Japanese phrases, furareta (振られた, meaning to get rejected)! Might as well turn it into a learning experience.
 
Also, as you say in your blog post: Speaking the local language really opens up lots of more possibilities. In China most people either speak very poor English, or (for the vast majority) do not speak any English at all.
 
The truth is (this is my gut feeling, you may challenge me on that ? ) about 95% of the woman will never consider dating a foreigner, about 5% would date both and then there is this tiny tiny fraction of women (actually significantly less than 1%) that will
exclusively target foreigners. They have the same weird motives of mixed blood child and this BS and some want to leave China ( a lot of Chinese people are not very happy with their lives).
 
Additionally, due to this stupid one child policy and the fact that still to this date women are considered as the inferior gender, men significantly outnumber the women. So there is a shortage of women especially in rural
areas. However, while men tend to stay at home the women tend to move into the big cities. Therefore in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen women outnumber men a little bit.

Due to these circumstances foreigners (applies only to males) are considered to be stealing Chinese women while women that date a foreigner are considered inferior and therefore dating a foreigner gets a pretty bad touch.
 
1. Some girls will want to fuck/date/bfgf because you are white. These tend to be 1-3s/10 with the occasional cute party girl, but these girls are low not just because of looks but they will have the worst personalities. Girls that like you for being white, black, American- these girls are the bottom of the barrel, girls that japanese guys tend to not like (its no wonder they suddenly quit and turn to foreigners).
 
I can 100% confirm this experience. In Tokyo it is easy to get with women, but remember there are over 40 million people living in that area. In reality there are not that many women interested in dating a foreigner, especially high quality women.
 
**Dating younger Japanese boyfriend**2010/10/7 16:32 Hi

So my bf is 4 years younger than me. He seems to like me but recently this difference has become an issue for me in terms of LTR settling down etc. We do not live together, but he is very faithful and sweet to me. 
He hasn't told his parents about us and we have had arguments about that. He say they are every conservative, but I'm not sure if it is because he is embarrassed by my age. 
He never comments on the age difference, and I've met all his friends also. 
Another issue is that we are in our thirties, so for me (being the woman and the oldest) I'd like to settle down soon and get kids before its too late, but he is just starting his career and seems to be very focused on it and not ready to settle down. 
Especially in terms of the settling down issue, i really have to be realistic about my wish to start family. I would hate to leave because of that, but I do not think we have a future together if he needs to spend too many years building his career before settling. I'm doing ok career wise myself. 
However, these issues are getting more and more on my nerves and I have slowly started planning on my future without him and emotionally separating myself. This is not the ideal solution for me though. 

what do you suggest i do?

**Hmm.**2010/10/7 23:48 I don't think his being Japanese has much to do with this situation. The clear fact is that you both want / need very different things from this relationship. You clearly have a desire to have children, whereas his interest is in furthering his career.

The most troubling facet though is that he hasn't even told his parents that he's dating you. This suggests that he doesn't see the relationship as a long-term proposal.

Do not argue with him about it. Just ask him for a conversation, take time out of your evenings to sit down over a meal and discuss the state of play. Make it clear to him that you are ready to have children (and don't think that anything short of "I am ready to have children" will get it through to him. He is unable to read your mind), and that if he is not ready you can only see it creating more divisiveness between you and perhaps it is best to end things there.

I have seen couples torn apart over the baby issue. Age isn't a factor. You may feel that your biological clock is ticking away, but it's worth bearing in mind that men don't quite have the same urgency - they're usually still fertile well into their Seventies, after all. If he wants children, then there's a problem elsewhere. If he doesn't, it'll tear you apart unless you walk away. But unless you discuss it using calm, non-emotive language, you won't be able to progress.

**...**2010/10/8 09:22 I don't think age is an issue and I won't comment on the baby aspect but I do think the career timing is a major hurdle. 

As a guy in his early thirties just getting his career rolling, if he likes what he's doing and want success in his job, "settling down" is probably the last thing he wants to do. 

A family and kids would effectively put the brakes on his career at a stage in life and economic environment where if you fall off track, you may not be able to get back on. 

Marriage and immediate kids for you two would either involve sacrificing his career or you making HUGE physical and mental sacrifice: basically being a single mother while he chances his career dreams for the next several years. 

I don't think it's impossible but you two need a lot more communication between you. 
You need to talk with your BF; just know that a lot of guys (myself included) in that position will choose career over relationship.by kyototransrate this post as useful
 
**=|**2010/10/8 18:37 First of all, the fact he hasn't told his parents about you two is a sign that settling down is not necessarily on his mind and marriage/kids would have to start with an introduction to his family.
Also, I too do not think age difference is the factor, but if you think he's mature enough to handle a serious conversation like that, definitely talk to him about it. 
Of course, if he wants to continue to be with you, the issue is going to come up sooner or later and I think it's better to have you both able to talk about it in rational conversation instead of waiting until you're fed up and force the issue when he's not ready. 
You of course have your needs and he has his and knowing what the other wants is a good indicator of where your relationship might head. Don't wait on it.
It may turn out that he lacks confidense in his ability to mentally and/or financially support a family.
Last point: I don't mean to generalize, but if he's an only son and expected to carry on the family legacy, the pressure on him is probably pretty heavy and mentioning /introducing potential marriage partners might send his parents right to the wedding planners and add to the stress (he probably gets harassed by them for not settling down) - not a strictly Japanese thing, but it's not uncommon in Japan.by jmarkleyrate this post as useful
 
If the guy is so ashamed to tell his family that he is dating a gaijin, drop him. His small penis will not give you any pleasure anyway. It is not like they are filthy rich like some of the Chinese people are, so their small wiener size cannot be made up with earning money since most Japanese men do not necessarily earn per hour what people do in the west. Are you aware that most Japanese men have experiences paying for sex? Unless you are comfortable dating men who have been with prostitutes, which is a deal breaker for most people, I would not touch these perverted men. You will see that most Japanese women know how much of a pig Japanese men are being misogynistic and all prefer to date white men.
 
For a Japanese boy to introduce his girl friend to his mother is an indication to his parents that he is going to marry with her. It has nothing to do with gaijin/Japanese thing, and purely a cultural difference.
 
wow! a very interesting read. sometimes i think it would be nice to have a japanese boyfriend, but then i think i only think so because i like toma. haha. probably would not work out if i actually tried finding one. xD
 
As a gay man that has been seeing a Japanese guy for a couple of months, it would have been nice to know whether t
