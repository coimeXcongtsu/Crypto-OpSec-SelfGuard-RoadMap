Hotspot Kits are checked out for 30 days and will renew up to three times after the original due date if there are no other customers waiting. Please monitor due dates to avoid being charged the full replacement cost of the Hotspot Kit.
 
Please take care of your Hotspot Kit. Fees will apply if the Wi-Fi hotspot or any accessory is lost or damaged. Library card privileges will be suspended until the Hotspot Kit is returned or charges on the account are paid.
 
You can check the availability of hotspots at your local branch by searching "mobile hotspot" in the library catalog or by calling any branch. If hotspots are not available, you may place a Hotspot Kit on hold. Only one hold is allowed per library account. Once you are notified that your Hotspot Kit is available, you will have seven business days to pick it up at your selected library location.
 
A **hotspot** is a satellite image pixel with high infrared intensity, indicating a heat source. Hotspots from known industrial sources are removed; the remaining hotspots represent vegetation fires, which can be in forest, grass, cropland, or logging debris. A hotspot may represent one fire or be one of several hotspots representing a larger fire. Not all fires can be identified from satellite imagery, either because the fires are too small or because cloud cover obscures the satellite's view of the ground.
 
I tried it just now and PA detected hotspot-shild app without SSL decrpytion. However i don't know what happens if you put it on block and app tries to connect to some less known IPs and/or URLs. I guess in that case SSL decryption is needed.
 
It seems that you are struggling with blocking Proxy applications like Hotspot Shield but the major point here is that you can only ensure that all Hotspot shield attempts are blocked by enabling the SSL Decryption.
 
As you say the SSL Decryption is not possible on your network then the possibility of the user to bypass the Firewall is high because these Proxy applications like Hotspot shield users IKE, IPSEC, SSH, SSL to create encrypted tunnels which will completely bypass the filtering...

You may block Unknown-UDP / TCP and it will block a considerable amount of users but again these apps are trying to bypass the limitation using these ports which will be very difficult to block with a security policy....
 
If they were connected to a network when they were started it will stay on that network or keep searching for that network until you manually put it into hotspot mode or restart them away from a known network.
 
For @calum.hoad : I feel your pain, I was stuck in Syria with them exactly like that. At least I could eventually find some internet, download the firmware and reflash them every morning. That is the only solution I have now.
 
**I wrote out the below info, then switched on our unit again to double check before sending, and the problem is back once more. Frustrated beyond belief. See below troubleshoot anyway, it worked for a joyful hour.**
 
Hi @josefnm , I think I may have found a temporary fix after spending the whole afternoon troubleshooting. Now when I power the units on and off, they seem to reliably default to broadcasting WiFi rather than searching networks. Details of what I did:
 
There's a bug in the GP client code that's encountered when connecting via an iPhone hotspot that's using an IPv6 only cell carrier where NAT64/CLAT are used. Under these conditions PanGPS segfaults and crashes while it's processing gateway's from what appears to be a null pointer dereference. The bugged logic seems to occur from the 192.0.0.2/32 your WiFi interface is receiving from the iPhones DHCP. Apple must have made a change here in one of the recent IOS updates.


 
If you are having MTU issues on Global Protect on TMobile the issue commonly presents as "gateway appears connected, but actual data will not pass through the created tunnel." So web sites will not work, outlook will not connect, etc even though the gateway appears connected in the Global Protect. If the problem is MTU, switching to SSL (though note it will not automatically fail over to SSL for this issue) will get connections flowing. Also as you have noted lowing the MTU helps as well. As far as I have seen MTU on Tmobile is 1420-ish. Thus as I understand, you would want the GP MTU setting to be Tmobile's MTU minus the IPSEC header size which will vary based on what encryption parameters you are using. Though I have been only working on this problem for a few days so most of my info is coming from what I learned over on /r/TmobileISP and from Tmobile's support forums.
 
To follow up on this question, as @Rich mentioned, currently, directly through Dropbox, there's no preference where you can specify which network connection/ mobile hotspot the desktop app will run and sync changes with (or pause, for that matter).
 
This is really great feedback that I'd be happy to log an official request on, in order to pass over to our team! 

All I can advise, is manually closing the Dropbox app so that it's not actively running and searching for changes to sync while you're connected through your mobile hotspot.

This is an essential feature for anyone who uses their phone as a mobile hotspot. OneDrive pauses automatically when a Wifi network is set to be a "Metered Connection". DropBox needs to do the same. Pausing manually is a non-starter as one is bound to forget to unpause when connecting to a non-metered Wifi network and therefore lose the opportunity to update the files.
 
Great question! I understand that you are not seeing the hand cursor when you hover over hotspots and you'd like to remove the hand cursor that appears on the video. I'd be happy to work with you to figure out what is going on!
 
Thanks for the follow-up! The trigger doesn't have to be a state change. It could be anything that is going to happen when the learner interacts with the hotspot (show a layer, jump to a slide, etc.). Here's an article that highlights making hotspots work.
 
I would like the cursor to change to a hand when users hover over the hotspot; that's why I selected "Hand cursor over hover" in the hotspot's right-click menu. How would I make that happen if "Hand cursor over hover" doesn't do that?
 
Changing the mouse cursor to a hand when hovering over a hotspot is meant to alert the learner that there's an interaction available. Depending on the trigger setup, the interaction can be activated by clicking or hovering over the hotspot. If the hotspot is not interactive due to the absence of a related trigger, the "Hand cursor over hover" setting does not apply.
 
I understand the function of the hand cursor - to notify users something's interactive - and how turning it off would "hide" the interactivity from users. That's why I turned it on; I want users to know something's interactive and click it.
 
What I don't understand is what the trigger setup would be and why I would need to take the additional step to make a trigger when the right-click menu communicates that the interactivity notification mechanism is already there - cursor changes to a hand.
 
I truly don't understand the extra step, not only in what the trigger would be but, from a user standpoint, why I'd even have to do it. I'm not trying to be dense; I just don't get it. If I select "Hand cursor on hover" I'd expect that to just happen without me making a trigger because that's what the toggle says.
 
A hotspot is not considered interactive without a trigger. When hotspots are first added to a slide, there is no associated trigger by default, so you're free to choose from the available triggers based on what interaction you'd like for the hotspot.
