Nintendo, the family-friendly console, had a pretty friendly reputation with politicians at the time **who blasted games such as MK**in particular for the violence and sanitized the game down to a barely PG rating. But Sega being the rebellious teenager it was, inserted its own middle finger to those opposing us of our right to play a game filled with blood and gore.
 
Mere weeks after Mortal Monday, Congress and Senator Joe Lieberman rallied to get parental guidance and ratings for video games mostly solely based on Mortal Kombat alone, and now with this added not-so-secret blood code from SEGA in the mix, it was only a matter of time before we got what we now know as these rating systems that we see on games purchased today; 30 years after MK dropped into our homes forever changing the history of at-home gaming.

At the end of the day and because of this cheat blood code, SEGA sold as much as five times more **MORTAL KOMBAT** games than Nintendo, which hit the Mario Party goers hard in the 16-bit console wars. However, NES learned their lesson when it was time to drop MK II and fully restored all the blood and guts into the game with no code needed.
 
While the game was loading, if you pressed the following combination of buttons on your controller you would be rewarded with 30 lives: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start. It was the ultimate cheat code and it allowed me and Jon to beat Contra every time.
 
The most prominent false cheat code is debt. Can I afford this purchase outright? Nope. But with debt? Of course! It could be a car, a house, a Peloton (No judgement; I just bought one. It was either that or a whole new set of pants), or Christmas gifts. Used wisely, debt can be helpful. But too much debt, committing too much of our future earnings to things we buy today, can be ruinous.
 
Both the Cheatcode and the DNA are advertised as the ultimate yoyo for learning fingerspin tricks. The Cheatcode is substantially wider and about 1g heavier than the DNA. Does that make it the better choice?
 
I learned with a shooting star. At first I kinda had to gently bend my finger to find the dimple and would lose some spin time. Once I figured out how to land in the dimple I was surprised how long it spins for. You can get some really damn long fingerspins with the shooting star. You kinda gotta throw it more flat I found to get in the dimple compared to my yoyos without a dimple.
 
@LX\_Emergency you really need to get yourself one of these, dude. The finger spin cup is like the perfect cross between the Shooting Star and the AOE. Besides that it also plays like a comp style yoyo.

What do I need to do to make the cheat codes I use to start up Knoppix, which has been installed to an SSD permanent? For example, I want to use "knoppix64 no3d tz=Asia/Shanghai" every single time I boot without needing to type it in. Can this be done, and if so, how?
 
Modify /home/knoppix/Desktop/KNOPPIX/boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg. Append the desired options to the line starting with APPEND located in the default boot string. The default boot string is specified at the beginning of the isolinux.cfg file. For example, Knoppix 7.2 isolinux.cfg starts with
 
Look for the line starting with LABEL Knoppix. Below this line is a line starting with APPEND. At the end of the APPEND string, add the options that you want to be active when you boot the default options. Using your question, you would add your options so that the default boot options would be
 
When first starting out, goalies tend to position more to the player than the puck. As they become more advanced, this obviously changes. Yet, there is a natural bias that can occur in the heat of battle.
 
As some of you know, I started dabbling at playing goalie this past year. While in net, I faced a left-handed player with whom I used to give private lessons. When I first came across him, he was a shooter, but he didn\u2019t know the finer details of goal scoring.
 
I taught this player the left-handed player\u2019s \u2018cheat code\u2019. Little did I know that two years & a hat trick later, I\u2019d be cursing the day I taught him that. After all, all three goals utilized the cheat code.
 
Shooting across your body involves more muscles and contouring into a proper body shape, particularly the core. There are fewer muscles to engage and people are naturally lazy, particularly when time is of the essence. It\u2019s much easier from a technique and muscle standpoint to go short-side (goalies, you\u2019re welcome).
 
A second key thing to notice here is how the stick is still covering the 5-hole (between the legs). This naturally leaves a goalie\u2019s blocker hand higher when going down into a butterfly position.
 
In slow motion, we can see how this naturally delays the reaction to a low blocker shot. While the glove hand starts to come down as the goalie drops, notice how the blocker hand stays elevated. This is valuable reaction time lost. Now if only my assistant could hit his spot, this would\u2019ve found the back of the net!
 
The world's best fingerspin yoyo, now supercharged by auto orientation technology. With a fingerspin dimple to make DNA tricks effortless and a competition weight distribution that makes tricks like 'Godspeed' easier!
 
In 2021 I designed and 3D printed a lot of random yoyos. One of them I printed was a yoyo to try and solve the shortcomings of the SKYVA and all the other yoyos on the market that used a similar style dimple. I printed this one prototype that did some crazy gyroscopic fingerspin thing where no matter what you did, you would end up in a fingerspin. I didn't know what to do with it though so it got abandoned and I moved onto other projects. Keep in mind this was before the whole Tiktok DNA trend happened so I just didn't think people would be that interested.
 
Fast forward a year later Brandon calls me and expresses interest in working on something together. Brandon helped me realize how many people were getting into the hobby through his social media. He didn't really have a product that was a "best all around yoyo".
 
This was important to me because as a kid, yoyoing taught me so many skills. Yoyoing taught me discipline, perseverance and so many other important life skills. Suddenly, when anything else in my life felt impossible, I always think back to when I first picked up yoyoing.
 
If I could develop a yoyo that brought down the learning barriers by a large margin, it would mean that more kids would stick to yoyoing, and hopefully also feel empowered in things later in life like school and work. This might not feel like a big deal, but it really shaped who I am as a person now, even 18 years later.
 
Brandon's contribution was vital during the design stage, since unlike me - he competes in yoyo contests a lot. Traditional fingerspin yoyos tend to focus so much on the ability to fingerspin that they sacrifice stability and spintime. Brandon was pretty adamant on getting this right, so I had to make many prototypes to fix stability issues making the Cheatcode a highly competition oriented yoyo.
 
Aside from the technical jargon, I also really wanted to convey mine and Brandon's friendship over the years - even including a silly photo of us on the packaging. Its kind of my one chance at feeling like a celebrity (haha). I hope our efforts show through with this design. It really pushed my limits on what can be done with a yoyo, both in branding and engineering. I'm just glad i got to do it with one of my best friends.
 
So, that's the full story of the CHEATCODE. It was a mission to get to where we are now, but I could not have done it without everyones love and support.   
  
We hope you love it as much as we loved creating it. It is always exciting to develop a product that has the potential to impact a new generation of players.

There are three different modes in The Sims 4: Create-a-Sim mode, Build mode, and Live mode. You can enter Build/Buy cheats in both Live mode or Build mode, but you must be in Build mode to use them. The Build mode cheats include codes for moving objects, expanding the Build/Buy catalog, and more.
 
Wanted to gather some opinions from the community about what 'IDKFA' stands for. I'd like to say it's "Id Keys and Full Arsenal" but I've heard it a few ways and wanted to get the general consensus from the group.
 
I always thought it was "keys and fucking ammo". Which that was probably what my young, warped little brain decided upon. If IDFA was "Fucking Ammo" then IDKFA would follow suit. It probably just means keys full ammo, or possibly full arsenal.
 
But given how mature the guys at id were when they named a gun the BFG9000, I wouldn't have put it past them to use the same nomenclature when deciding an acronym for a cheat code. It doesn't really matter what they actually meant it to be, it will always be keys and fucking ammo to me.
 
You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.
 
Also, do we know for sure that backtostart can no longer cause the awful all-empty-containers bug? I can't remember if that ever surfaced in Mutagen or not. There's not so much reason to use the code in Geneforge, so it might not have had much chance to surface.
 
**Why Swamps?**Data backs up what Grandpa said. One of the best examples comes from a study conducted by the University of Delaware and the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife. The researchers captured and collared adult bucks and does, collecting data over four years across the southern part of their state. One takeaway stood out above all
