The Norman Paterson School of International Affairs (NPSIA) was established in the mid-1960s with the generous support of the late Senator Norman M. Paterson to encourage and promote graduate study and professional research and publications in the field of international affairs. The NPSIA program is interdisciplinary, reflecting the philosophy that exposure to a range of disciplines is necessary to develop an understanding of our complex global environment.

Students will be required to withdraw from the program if their grade point average falls below 7.0 (B-), or if they receive a grade of less than B- in any two courses that are eligible to be counted toward the Master's degree.
 
Students admitted to the NPSIA M.A. program must have successfully completed a 1.0 credit (or the equivalent) course in introductory economics (introductory microeconomics and introductory macroeconomics for economics majors) before starting the program.
 
Students who have not completed one credit of introductory economics at the time of their application will have their admission into the program made conditional upon its successful completion prior to registration. In some cases where the student is deemed by the admissions committee to have an insufficient background in international affairs they may be required to complete up to two additional courses as part of their M.A. program. Students who are uncertain about whether they meet the background requirements are encouraged to contact the School of International Affairs.
 
Most students are admitted to the full-time program and must complete all of the degree requirements within two calendar years or six terms of full-time study. In exceptional cases, students may complete the program within one calendar year.
 
Students in the full-time M.A. program who demonstrate outstanding academic performance and research potential may, with permission of the Associate Director, be admitted to the Ph.D. program after two terms of registration.
 
Students considering this option will be advised, when selecting courses for their M.A. program, to choose those courses at the master's level which are open to doctoral students and which may assist them in the doctoral comprehensive examinations.
 
Full-time M.A.students who have completed 3.0 credits in the program may select a co-op option. The co-op program provides opportunities to integrate the theoretical and practical aspects of international affairs.
 
The 0.0 credit co-op is in addition to the 5.0 credits required for the M.A., and a minimum of two co-op terms must be successfully completed before the student is eligible to receive a co-op designation on their academic transcript. Students register in the co-op course INAF 5913 and are restricted from taking more than 0.5 credit at the same time.
 
Work terms are four months in duration, and typically students are employed at the junior officer level in government departments or other organizations. Information and procedures can be obtained from the Carleton University Co-op Office.
 
In some cases, an applicant with relevant full-time employment experience may be admitted to a part-time M.A. program. While the program requirements are the same as those for full-time students, part-time students may take up to six calendar years from the date of initial registration to complete the program.
 
Part-time students must register for a minimum of one term in three, and must successfully complete INAF 5001 by the end of the Winter term following the first Fall registration. In addition, the economics and compulsory cluster course requirements must be included in the first 2.5 credits completed.
 
Students who elect to complete the program by a combination of full- and part-time study are governed by the following time limits: five calendar years if the candidate is registered full-time for two or three terms and part-time for the balance; four calendar years if the candidate is registered full-time for four or five terms and part-time for the balance.
 
The Norman Paterson School of International Affairs and the Common Law Section of the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa offer a joint Master of Arts in International Affairs and Juris Doctor (M.A./JD). The benefit of the joint program is the integration of students, legal training and graduate studies in international affairs.
 
Please Note: Students must apply separately to the Faculty of Law, Common Law Section, at the University of Ottawa and to the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, and be accepted by both institutions in accordance with the normal admission requirements of each program. Interest in pursuing the joint program must be specified in each application.
 
Students will make up any additional M.A. credit requirements. These could include an M.A./JD research essay (INAF 5906) or M.A./JD research thesis (INAF 5919). M.A./JD research essays and theses will have at least one supervisor from NPSIA and one supervisor from the Law School.
 
NPSIA's Ph.D. program is interdisciplinary and focuses on international policymaking processes and institutions. Its objective is to provide students with advanced training and research skills suitable for both an academic career, or for more senior policy analysis and research positions in government and non-governmental institutions.
 
Interdisciplinary and policy-oriented research on international and intrastate conflict management and resolution.
