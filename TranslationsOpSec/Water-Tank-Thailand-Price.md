DOS, Safe Tank, Diamond are three brands worth your time and consideration. Each of those three have different styles of tanks. Your hatch situation is not unique and worth checking each company. Each of those three brands offers different series of plastic water tanks. The price will reflect the quality of the materials.
 
^Correct me if I am wrong but as SS is basically Iron with added chromium, its not the iron that causes the damage but the hydrogen sulphide that can be present, if your water is high in H2S you pretty well screwed anyway ????
 
Turns out Wave and DOS at 2,000 liter size have small hatches so I will go with the sandstone that I have used before - steel is ugly - not being considered. Spraying is a messy solution and still won't look right.
 
Do you have a crunchy-bits filter on the feed to your tank? If not, adding a simple polypropylene filter will reduce the amount of sediment build up in the tank. The filter is far easier to clean ????

Not sure what you mean by crunchy bits but I have water from underground being pumped up a hill to a holding tank then up the hill to tanks with a Hitachi pump to push from the tank through a resin and carbon filter then downhill via gravity to my house (2 floors).
 
My DOS Tank is six years old now never had to clean it out, I have a large drip irrigation screen filter in the feed line I clean every so often filled with crap from village well water but doesnt make it into the tank. Clean in Clean out. Never had a pump problem either due to this filter cleaning the water.
 
This is my drip irrigation filter, I had a larger one but this one has a double screen system. The red outer filter catches all the sediment and rocks etc. while the blue inner filter is even finer screen which never has much on it. You can see all the mud/sediment on the red filter before a toothbrush with bleach cleaned it up As long as the water supply pressure stays steady I only clean it every month or so, takes ten minutes. Dissolved minerals not much you can do about them really, every so often i pull all the faucet screens and the shower head and soak in vinegar to clean out the lime/calcium buildup. My RO water system has a clear sediment filter case so I can see when it needs changing which isnt very often. One big problem here is the water pressure variations cause the pipes to contaminate the water supply with junk, anytime a pipe loses pressure the crap on the pipe walls falls off into the water supply.
 
I see plenty of water tanks and drip irrigation filters on show in Buriram this week at the Buriram Home Builders Expo. It is not a boring shopping trip as the technical staff are very helpful. Netafim is a brand of Crop irrigation and Rainbird is a garden sprinkler system I am familiar with in Buriram Thailand.
 
I was planning in putting in a tank of around 1200ltr to feed the house supply, water is from the mains, but occasional water cuts we've seen for as long as 24 hours or more got me thinking to install a larger tank just to be on the safe side, however I've just returned from UK where I had to go due to the sudden passing of my father and my brother mentioned to consider not opting for too big a tank due to some water borne disease risks from largely unused water, I think he mentioned legionella although happy to be corrected on that one if I'm wrong, are there similar water borne diseases that should be considered when opting to install a larger water tank than may/may not be required
 
We have 1500 l tank which I figure turns over every 3 days (3 people). While both the 'city' water and our bore pump water appears clear (no smells, etc.) I put a cap of bleach in the tank on a daily basis.
 
Water usage varies... In our house of 4, we average 1,000L/day. We have 6,000L of storage (2x 3,000L), mains water is filtered via sand, carbon, resin and then activated carbon before going into the tanks, and both tanks get flushed and cleaned every 2-3 months. We have never had a problem with water quality.
 
We were quoted 50k. Sorry, i don't know the size but it would apparently be a big tank. And that price includes labor and everything else required to install it and get water to the house (not the pump or the hole dug for the well...we already have that).
 
we will also have 4 occupants so maybe 1200ltr tank wouldn't be too far off the mark. Apologies, Wasn't thinking at the time of posting about emptying the tanks every so often so I'd imagine that'd solve any possible issues regarding water related diseases
 
My 3,000L stainless tanks cost me 18K each 3 years back. Have never seen a domestic sized tank for anything close to 50K - 3,000L ones are already > 2M high... As for plumbing, it's all just relatively cheap PVC pipes, fittings, valves and a float valve - maybe 1K baht all up..
 
if you're serious about cleaning the tank regularly, consider 2x 600L tanks instead of 1x 1,200L, and add in another valve so you can keep water in one tank (and pump not running dry) while cleaning the other. A few more PVC valves and another float valve and you'll be able to set it up so you can pump the water from the full tank to the empty tank on cleaning day, so less water gets wasted, and everything continues working inside the house while you're doing the cleaning.
 
Plastic OK if you keep out of direct sunlight. Ours is the blue kind and after 4 years (and daily dosage of bleach) has a bit of 'crusting' at the top but the rest of the tank free from algae and no other issues.
 
SS tanks do not require bleach and only a yearly clean-out is normal (muck). Plastic in or out of sunlight will soon become an algae factory without chlorine but there is a sandstone plastic that does not allow sun to enter that has been reported as a good alternative to SS (especially cheap SS which can become pitted with minerals/salt).
 
I will try to go for SS and maybe look into the sandstone plastic. With regards to SS and the mineral/salt problem, are you aware of any particular brand that is known to have good quality SS. Likewise, any brand that should be avoided?
 
Top grade thicker stainless steel water tanks are available perhaps at a lower cost with free delivery and the option for professional installation from the "Go To Pump Shop" in your Province. Every Thailand Province has one or two "Water Pump shops" that do a serious business in sales and installation of water pumps, booster pumps, water filter systems and water storage tanks for for Municipal Buildings, Universities, multi story apartment buildings, student dormitories, and Hospitals large and small. In Buriram at the shop I bought and had installed seven 2000 liter water storage tanks from Diamond Brand Sandstone LLDPE tanks, the current everyday price for the 18-8 top grade Red Advanced Stainless Steel Water Tank is:
 
The above prices should be easy to match in any province in Thailand. **The above prices include free local delivery** on a proper truck in Buriram from Buriram Builders Merchants Ruangsangthai Hardware which is located five minutes from the Buriram Ekachon Private Hospital on Highway 2074.
 
I was actually thinking an old fashioned "ong" might look very well, and they are apparently only 1300 baht for a large one about 6ft high which probably holds a ton and a half or of water, maybe more, and should be fine for our little bungalow.
