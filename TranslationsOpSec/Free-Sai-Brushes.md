I've been asked many times about the brushes that I used for my daily sketches. I don't remember where I got it exactly but here is my brush set that includes the few ones I use often. (It took me a while to organize them but here they are :D)
 
Many of the brushes are from my collection from different artists over the years. For the few brushes that I do remember the source, a directly link to the original brush set is added in the preview pdf. So make sure you check those artists out as well! Some of the other brushes were created specifically for my work, but hope you'll find it fun to use as well. :)

I accidentally fell in love with the desert in 2017 when I moved to Arizona looking for adventure. Through exploring the desert scenery I found an abundance of color and inspiration and was motivated to pick up my long-abandoned paint brushes. Soon, Brushes and Boots was born.
 
I noticed that when I imported "DAUB | Comics Basic Set.afbrushes" in vector mode ("draw persona"), this set was not available, but is available in the raster mode ("pixel persona"). So, from this I conclude that \*.abr or \*.afbrushes are vector or raster specific.
 
When importing brushes it doesn't matter which persona you're in, they will import into the correct one depending on the brushes. Raster brushes will only be available in the Pixel persona and Vector in the Draw persona, switching between the two allows you to use them on one publication
 
Hi, I have the trial version, I tried making the thick/thin brush (the ends are pointed, middle is thicker). It looked fine in the Brush window, but when I drew with the brush tool it came out as the regular 'normal' stroke without the thick/thin ends. Is there a tutorial on this or is it because it doesn't work in the trial version?
 
hi - i am having trouble importing brushes both vector and raster that have been purchased and downloaded. i unzip the file- go to import brushes in correct persona- select file- then get this message- "unexpected brush format
 
A while ago I posted above questions. Well, it is clear for me. There are vector and raster brushes available. The vector brushes are available in the draw persona and the raster brushes in the pixel persona. In each persona you can import both type of brushes. Once imported you can only use them in the specific persona.
 
Interdental brushes are highly effective in removing dental plaque between teeth, plus interdental brushes are also often easier to use compared to other options, such as floss. In most cases, interdental brushes are the most efficient tool to prevent gum inflammation and cavities. Read our instruction guide on how to clean between your teeth with TePe Interdental Brushes and what sets them apart.

I saved them a while ago, as I find it hard to always keep this in mind. 

It does have a size limitation, I do not particularly understand why is this not made public knowledge by Adobe, there are so many similar problems. But what truly boggles my mind is why there is no pop-up warning, "dude, you're exceeding the memory limit", something, as I cannot waste my time with these concerns and constantly check the size of the brushes I import, the size of the library and so on.
 
What is most frustrating is that I do have the Brushes.psp file. It's not magically gone, it's just 2 Mb over the limit, but now I cannot do anything with it, as PS won't open it. So I posted hoping that someone from Adobe would know how to reduce this size through some bit of coding, but I presume they don't even read such topics. 

An auto-backup system for such things would be very welcome by default, I am no expert programmer, but it doesn't seem impossible to implement, they do it in games with infinitely more variables than a mere brush set. Even PS does it with autosaving files. But autosaving brush libraries beyond the limit that the program can open makes absolutely zero sense to me. Why do you save it if you know you cannot open it? Why is no warning triggered? 

It is my fault for not saving everything, that I do admit. But there is also the sheer lack of quite obvious Quality of Life improvements. But then again, Adobe never cared too much for digital painters.
 
I have tried System Restore from Windows. Not only it didn't fix anything, but it also bugged my Chrome browser so that it would not open, so I spent an extra hour of my life troubleshooting that. 

Pretty sure the people from Adobe are aware of this problem, it doesn't take too much logic to realize that overwriting the library file beyond the reading capacity of the program is not exactly good programming. But they did it anyway.
 
I did a Forum search and the issue seems to come up extremely rarely, so please post a Bug Report (or Feature Request) to make sure to remind the Photoshop team that the issue exists/persists AND that there are people affected by it.
 
While I agree with your statement about staff (although the product needs to be fixed and updated regardless of its original designers, it's a service, it can't depend on a particular group of employees), the issue is far from being extremely rare, it's common knowledge among artist circles among many other problems that Adobe has ignored for years. People probably read the other posts, as well as the topics on Reddit, and they only see peers complaining and no real solution. I did that, as well, I read everything before deciding to post about it.
 
I posted in the Feature Request section. I have read that thread, but the 2 Gb limit is real and has no workaround until they actually do something about it. It does sound like more of a bug than a feature.

I wanted help with this problem now, not in the far distant future with some extra feature they \*may\* implement in 2030 (plenty of old topics done on the matter, utterly and completely ignored). But this is the last time I waste an entire day with such problems, if I cannot make it myself, I'll hire someone to write me a script to autosave those brushes each time I import a new brush pack.

Still, it's unbelievable to me that Adobe cannot handle something so basic, and in 2023 this is still a thing.
 
@kdoggdracul 
I have the same problem. I'm also a digital painter and if my Brushes.psp file is larger than 2Gb, I lose them when Photoshop launches.
I actually save my brushes in another location on my hard drive so that when this happens, I can reload my brushes easily.
 
To make my Brushes.psp size smaller, I open the original brushes open in Photoshop, I delete the brushes out of sets that I don't use and then save those brushes as new abr. and name them accordingly.
 
@c.pfaffenbichler 
No, the brushes folder is empty in my \AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2023\Presets\Brushes.
Ever since I had PS CC (after CS6) I always saved my extra brushes in another location as I was told years ago that having too many brushes loaded could slow PS performance.
 
Yes, thank you. I used to keep them around 1.7 Gb, as well, but it was negligent of me to not save them. I exceeded the memory limit by 2 Mb, now I have to go through the pain of restoring everything, WHILE keeping in mind to constantly save my brushes, because Adobe cannot make a checkmark for that to handle itself or at least extend the memory limit or give a warning of some kind. 

I really understand why a lot of people switch from this software.
 
Hello, 

I am using Adobe CC2019. I don't know the exact version, but this is not a version-specific bug, it happened to me multiple times with all kinds of versions, on multiple machines. It's very easy to replicate if you have enough brush packs to load into Photoshop, and for a digital painter, hoarding tons of brushes is quite common. Once Brushes.psp gets over 2 Gb, they are all gone and the default brushes are reinstated. 

Is there a workaround for decreasing the size of this file, so I can get my brushes back?
 
No, I have not. There have been plenty of problems with the yearly updates, in terms of brush lag and such, that I am not so keen on trying other updates on this particular PC at home, where I paint. I may try it at work one day. Why, is the 2 Gb limit removed in PS 2023?
