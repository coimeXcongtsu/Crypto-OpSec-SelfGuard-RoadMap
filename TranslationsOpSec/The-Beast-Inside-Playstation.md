What is fear, fear is an emotional response to visual and auditory stimulation brought on by danger and or the perception of danger. The horror genre has been able to play on those emotions to deliver games that will make you jump out of your seat or even have issues sleeping at night. The beast inside takes the player through a story of past and present while solving puzzles and obstacles. This, of course, is while being shocked and frightened at various turns. This is our review of The Beast Inside.

I would say this game falls in the same lines as Amnesia: the Dark decent as they have very similar mechanics. Do not get me wrong I am not bagging on this at all in fact for me this is a plus. Recently I have been lucky to experience a bit more of the horror genre than before and has allowed me to experience different mechanics and ideas that are very indulgent to me. One of my favorite mechanics is the ability to interact with my environment, by having this type of interaction a player will have a better sense of being part of the story. When I think of being immersed I do not think just a good story is everything. At times you need to feel like you are right there getting your hands dirty and of course, getting randomly scared out of your mind is key.
 
Graphically speaking the game is very appealing as the developer has made good use of the unreal engine combined with a 3D Scanned environment. The texturing of the models is very well on point with only minor glitches from time to time. The attention to detail on each area very well thought out and plenty of items to interact with. Some items even hold hints or messages to help drive the story. Right at the start, you find a hidden spot with a box that requires you to break the code in order to access it. This immediately thrilled me as puzzles and challenges really get my mind working. I will admit at first it took me a moment to realize when the game switched from one character to another, I thought at first I was merely transferred in time or seeing the past. Well once the reality of what was going on set in and my dumb moment was over I moved on.
 
The overall gameplay as mentioned was focused on interactions but after a few hours in-game it does seem to switch focus to a more of a First-person Shooter. This of course for me was easy to overlook as story-driven games often need to include various elements to keep things going. The controls were tested both with a traditional keyboard and mouse as well as the use of a wired USB Xbox controller. Both were fairly easy to adjust to and play with no input lag.

After getting through all of Old Yharnam, you finally come upon an old church. Unfortunately for you, there is no sanctuary inside; just horror. The Bloodstarved Beast has made her home there and her erratic movement and devastating combo attacks are sure to gut you before you can so much as scream.
 
More than likely, newer players would categorize this as the hardest boss. She isn't humanoid like Gascoigne and she isn't as slow as the Cleric Beast. This is the boss that is most likely to make players quit Bloodborne as she is hard to best if you're using the wrong strategy.
 
Something that makes the Bloodstarved Beast so hard to kill is just how hard she is to predict. The flaps of skin that have been flayed from her back dangle over her face and obstruct your view. But a good general tip is to **dodge through her attacks so you get behind**. This is very counterintuitive because yes: who in their right mind would want to go TOWARDS those ferocious claws? But, trust that it works.
 
Bloodstarved Beast's attacks primarily hit in front of her, so dodging towards her and to her sides is your best bet. There is also one attack she has that you can punish for a visceral attack. When she rears her right arm up and back, blast her with a blunderbuss and that should stagger her, enabling you to perform a visceral attack for massive damage.
 
This fight is also split up into three stages. In the first, the beast will slash at you and try to grab you. The second, which starts once she's lost about a third of her HP, causes her attacks to slowly start to poison you. Bringing antidotes for this fight is a must. Once her health is down to about a third, she will roar and start excreting a poison mist that will cloud around her. In this phase, even being near it will build up your poison. As some players might have guessed, **this fight acts as a DPS check**. You won't be able to win if your hits aren't killing her before the poison kills you. Make sure you've **upgraded your weapon** a few times and this fight should go a lot more smoothly.
 
As with any beast enemy, Bloodstarved Beast is extremely vulnerable to fire. However, molotovs probably aren't your best bet for this fight as they take time to throw and the beast can dodge them pretty easily. Instead, try fire paper -- something that will set your weapon ablaze and allow you to deal more damage. In theory, any weapon will do here, but given how quick the beast is, you'll probably want something quick yourself.
 
Some good gear to bring to the fight, other than antidotes and fire paper, are pungent blood cocktails. These will distract her for a few seconds, so throw one in the corner and wail on her while she attacks it. Also, having the Black Church Set, Yharnam Hunter Set, or Gascoigne Set would be useful as all have good poison resistance.
 
One final piece of advice: **use the pillars.**This arena can be used to your advantage by putting a pillar between you and Skin Flaps whenever you need to heal or use an item. It'll prevent her from rushing you and clawing you to death with those few valuable seconds.
