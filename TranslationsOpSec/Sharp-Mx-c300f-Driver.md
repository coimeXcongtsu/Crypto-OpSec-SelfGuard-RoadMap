In excel, highlight the column of client names and click the Sort and Filter button on the ribbon, then click Sort A to Z, it will ask you whether or not you want to expand the selection(choose to expand it), and it will alphabetize them for you and rearrange the numbers to line up with the names in the appropriate rows.

Some models you have to use the User Name and password type authentication, some models work with either the Username and Password, or the User Number type. It also helps to make each user an administrator if you arent worried about them printing color.
 
I am very glad to know that how can we Setup Sharp User Control. I was searching from many days to get this information and finally your blog have been found. you have solved my biggest problem. Really really thanks for this great work.
 
I had follow the instruction written, but it still can print out directly without entering user number.
It seem that it only not allow user to use scan or fax if not key in the correct user number, but for printing, user can print directly even without login.
 
You should be able to, yes. If you tweak the settings on the Authority Group page under User Control you can make a group that has access to only these things. Then when you create your user just assign them to that Authority Group using the drop down menu labeled Authority Group. Collin @ Skelton

I have found some instructional links around on the internet but they seem to only go up to 10.9 and after downloading the appropriate driver from Sharp for my MX-3610N, the menu item for Job Handling does not appear in the selections when you open a print dialog and click on the menu where it is supposed to be based on my review of the instructions for 10.9 found on the web.
 
We use MX-M62en. We want to bill our clients for copies/prints we do on their jobs.
We set up numbered accounts but it is a big delay, to login and then have to enter a 5 digit user # ea time.
Our older Canon was way easier.
What is the simplest way to track the prints we do for our clients? At any one time, we may only have 10 or 20 to track.
TIA!
 
If you followed the procedure here you should only have to enter your 5 digit code and hit OK and it will let you in. You shouldnt have to login with a username/password and then enter a 5 digit code.
 
Thanks. Yes, we did figure that out. However, at least on our M623N, as we switch back and forth between clients frequently and so we have to open printer preferences, then open job handling and then change the user number. Whereas with Canon everytime we print (Control P) the user acc box automatically pops up and we just enter the acct # and press print.
 
Also on the Sharp to enter new user accounts IT ALWAYS goes back to number 50 -40and down and to enter such as a new acc # 8, we have to back select previous a number of times to get to acct ranges that include #8 Then as soon as that is saved, it goes back to 50-40 and again and again we have to then press previous a number of times to get to 1-10.
 
Is there a way to automatically collect the job logs from like 5-6 MFPs in the network and combine it into one Excel + clear the job log counter?
If it could run in a schedule it would be better.
 
On a Sharp MX-3070, is there a way to set Job Handling => Hold Only to affect only my print jobs? If I set this and put in a PIN Code on my Windows 7 client computer, it changes it globally for all users using that printer from the print server.
 
Hello, We use RDP connections from Thin Clients to connect our users to their remote desktops. The users then have access to a shared networked Sharp MX2640. Is ther any way that we can configure the printer to hold users jobs until they physically visit the printer and enter their credentials.
 
IN OUR COMPANY WE ARE USING SHARP MX264N PRINTER. I NEED A GUIDANCE TO RESTRICT THE WASTAGE PRINTOUT. THE QUESTION IS THE PRINTER SHOULD ASK FOR A PASSWORD AFTER I GAVE PRINT FROM MY SYSTEM(SHOULD BE APPLICABLE FOR ALL USERS).WITHOUT ENTERING THE PASSWORD IN THE PRINTER, PRINT OUT SHOULD NOT COMES OUT. IS IT POSSIBLE. KINDLY CLARIFY.
 
Hi, please, could you tell me if its possible to set up black print with blank user number and color with some user number. How does it affect users with not blank user number when i remove it? Thank you for reply.
 
I scan hundreds of files per day sometimes. I would like it to keep my name in the que and let me just put in my next scan with out having to press address, find my name and his send each and every time. Can that be done.
 
You can set the faxes up to go to a network folder, but it will not be able to distinguish which department it is for. You can have an administrator periodically check the file and distribute them to the correct department. Here are instructions on how to setup inbound fax routing. =vgAhaxmUgw8

Hello Erik here, What options do I have on my mx-4111n to make it so all user have to enter there color code number before printing. The option in printer properties under job handling is easy for them to turn off and manipulate. I was hoping fro a more secure option? Thank you
 
My school is using Sharp MX-5070V.
I added an user with user number through printer web page and added user number
in the printer in the user laptop. When I print it is printing straightway, printer is not waiting for the user number. Could you let me know how to resolve this issue.
