Although the term "guerrilla warfare" was coined in the context of the Peninsular War in the 19th century,[2] the tactical methods of guerrilla warfare have long been in use. In the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu proposed the use of guerrilla-style tactics in *The Art of War*. The 3rd century BC Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus is also credited with inventing many of the tactics of guerrilla warfare through what is today called the Fabian strategy. Guerrilla warfare has been used by various factions throughout history and is particularly associated with revolutionary movements and popular resistance against invading or occupying armies.
 
Guerrilla tactics focus on avoiding head-on confrontations with enemy armies, typically due to inferior arms or forces, and instead engage in limited skirmishes with the goal of exhausting adversaries and forcing them to withdraw (see also attrition warfare). Organized guerrilla groups often depend on the support of either the local population or foreign backers who sympathize with the guerrilla group's efforts.
 
The Spanish word guerrilla is the diminutive form of guerra ("war"); hence, "little war". The term became popular during the early-19th century Peninsular War, when, after the defeat of their regular armies, the Spanish and Portuguese people successfully rose against the Napoleonic troops and defeated a highly superior army using the guerrilla strategy in combination with a scorched earth policy and people's war (see also attrition warfare against Napoleon). In correct Spanish usage, a person who is a member of a guerrilla unit is a guerrillero ([geriˈʎeɾo]) if male, or a guerrillera ([geriˈʎeɾa]) if female. Arthur Wellesley adopted the term "guerrilla" into English from Spanish usage in 1809,[2] to refer to the individual *fighters* (e.g., "I have recommended to set the Guerrillas to work"), and also (as in Spanish) to denote *a group or band* of such fighters. However, in most languages *guerrilla* still denotes a specific style of warfare. The use of the diminutive evokes the differences in number, scale, and scope between the guerrilla army and the formal, professional army of the state.[3]

Primitive (and guerrilla) warfare consists of war stripped to its essentials: the murder of enemies; the theft or destruction of their sustenance, wealth, and essential resources; and the inducement in them of insecurity and terror. It conducts the basic business of war without recourse to ponderous formations or equipment, complicated maneuvers, strict chains of command, calculated strategies, timetables, or other civilized embellishments.[4]
 
Evidence of conventional warfare, on the other hand, did not emerge until 3100 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu, in his *The Art of War* (6th century BC), became one of the earliest to propose the use of guerrilla warfare.[5] This inspired developments in modern guerrilla warfare.[6]
 
In the 3rd century BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, used elements of guerrilla warfare, such as the evasion of battle, the attempt to wear down the enemy, to attack small detachments in an ambush[7] and devised the Fabian strategy, which the Roman Republic used to great effect against Hannibal's army, see also *His Excellency : George Washington*: the Fabian choice.[8] The Roman general Quintus Sertorius is also noted for his skillful use of guerrilla warfare during his revolt against the Roman Senate.
 
In the medieval Roman Empire, guerrilla warfare was frequently practiced between the eighth through tenth centuries along the eastern frontier with the Umayyad and then Abbasid caliphates. Tactics involved a heavy emphasis on reconnaissance and intelligence, shadowing the enemy, evacuating threatened population centres, and attacking when the enemy dispersed to raid.[9] In the later tenth century this form of warfare was codified in a military manual known by its later Latin name as *De velitatione bellica* ('On Skirmishing') so it would not be forgotten in the future.[10]
 
In the 17th century, Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Kingdom, pioneered the *Shiva sutra* or *Ganimi Kava* (Guerrilla Tactics) to defeat the many times larger and more powerful armies of the Mughal Empire.[13]
 
The Dominican Restoration War was a guerrilla war between 1863 and 1865 in the Dominican Republic between nationalists and Spain, the latter of which had recolonized the country 17 years after its independence. The war resulted in the withdrawal of Spanish forces and the establishment of a second republic in the Dominican Republic.[15]
 
The Algerian Revolution of 1954 started with a handful of Algerian guerrillas. Primitively armed, the guerrillas fought the French for over eight years. This remains a prototype for modern insurgency and counterinsurgency, terrorism, torture, and asymmetric warfare prevalent throughout the world today.[21] In South Africa, African National Congress (ANC) members studied the Algerian War, prior to the release and apotheosis of Nelson Mandela;[22] in their intifada against Israel, Palestinian fighters have sought to emulate it.[23] Additionally, the tactics of Al-Qaeda closely resemble those of the Algerians.[24]
 
The growth of guerrilla warfare was inspired in part by theoretical works on guerrilla warfare, starting with the *Manual de Guerra de Guerrillas* by Matas Ramn Mella written in the 19th century:
 
More recently, Mao Zedong's *On Guerrilla Warfare*,[26] Che Guevara's *Guerrilla Warfare*,[27] and Lenin's *Guerrilla warfare*,[28] were all written after the successful revolutions carried out by them in China, Cuba and Russia, respectively. Those texts characterized the tactic of guerrilla warfare as, according to Che Guevara's text, being "used by the side which is supported by a majority but which possesses a much smaller number of arms for use in defense against oppression".[29]
 
Why does the guerrilla fighter fight? We must come to the inevitable conclusion that the guerrilla fighter is a social reformer, that he takes up arms responding to the angry protest of the people against their oppressors, and that he fights in order to change the social system that keeps all his unarmed brothers in ignominy and misery.
 
In the 1960s, the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara developed the *foco* (Spanish: foquismo) theory of revolution in his book *Guerrilla Warfare*,[31] based on his experiences during the 1959 Cuban Revolution. This theory was later formalized as "focal-ism" by Rgis Debray. Its central principle is that vanguardism by cadres of small, fast-moving paramilitary groups can provide a focus for popular discontent against a sitting regime, and thereby lead a general insurrection. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many *foco* ideas were adapted into urban guerrilla warfare movements.
 
Guerrilla warfare is a type of asymmetric warfare: competition between opponents of unequal strength.[32] It is also a type of irregular warfare: that is, it aims not simply to defeat an invading enemy, but to win popular support and political influence, to the enemy's cost. Accordingly, guerrilla strategy aims to magnify the impact of a small, mobile force on a larger, more cumbersome one.[33] If successful, guerrillas weaken their enemy by attrition, eventually forcing them to withdraw.
 
Tactically, guerrillas usually avoid confrontation with large units and formations of enemy troops but seek and attack small groups of enemy personnel and resources to gradually deplete the opposing force while minimizing their own losses. The guerrilla prizes mobility, secrecy, and surprise, organizing in small units and taking advantage of terrain that is difficult for larger units to use. For example, Mao Zedong summarized basic guerrilla tactics at the beginning of the Chinese Civil War as:
 
At least one author credits the ancient Chinese work *The Art of War* with inspiring Mao's tactics.[35] In the 20th century, other communist leaders, including North Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, often used and developed guerrilla warfare tactics, which provided a model for their use elsewhere, leading to the Cuban "foco" theory and the anti-Soviet Mujahadeen in Afghanistan.[36]
 
Guerrilla groups may use improvised explosive devices and logistical support by the local population. The opposing army may come at last to suspect all civilians as potential guerrilla backers. The guerrillas might get political support from foreign backers and many guerrilla groups are adept at public persuasion through propaganda and use of force.[37] Some guerrilla movements today also rely heavily on children as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles.[38] Many governments and states also recruit children within their armed forces.[39][40]
 
No commonly accepted definition of "terrorism" has attained clear consensus.[41][42][43] The term "terrorism" is often used as political propaganda by belligerents (most often by governments in power) to denounce opponents whose status as terrorists is disputed.[44][45]
 
Throughout the American Civil War, as vast armies in blue and gray clashed on conventional battlefields, a drastically different kind of conflict was raging as well: a bloody guerrilla war that erupted in the South in response to Federal invasion. Characterized by ambushes, surprise raids, a
