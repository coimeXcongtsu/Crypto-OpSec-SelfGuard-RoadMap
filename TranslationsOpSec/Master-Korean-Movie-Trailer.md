The Motor Vehicle Service and Repair Act, Act 300 of 1974, (the Act) regulates the practice of servicing and repairing motor vehicles; proscribes unfair and deceptive practices; provides for training and certification of mechanics; provides for the registration of motor vehicle repair facilities; provides for enforcement; and prescribes penalties.
 
[MCL 257.1304]:
Unless the act or practice of repairing, servicing, reconditioning, or engaging in the activity of a master or specialty mechanic is adopted for the purposes of evading this act, this act shall not apply to a person who:
 
(a) Repairs, replaces, reconditions, adjusts, analyzes, diagnoses, or alters the operating condition of his or her own or a family member's motor vehicle and for which there is evidence of ownership of that motor vehicle.

(b) Is a master or specialty mechanic, a motor vehicle mechanic, a mechanic trainee, or technician who is in the full-time employ of an automotive manufacturer and is engaged solely in that capacity on motor vehicles owned by or being produced by the manufacturer.
 
(c) Engages solely in the business of repairing the motor vehicles for compensation of a single commercial, industrial, or governmental establishment, or 2 or more establishments related by common ownership or corporate affiliation.
 
(d) Engages solely in the business of repairing, replacing, reconditioning, adjusting, analyzing, diagnosing, or altering the operating condition of a motor vehicle or trailer not required to be registered and not titled under Act No. 300 of the Public Acts of 1949, as amended, being sections 257.1 to 257.923 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The business they work for is not required to be registered as a repair facility and only provides bench repairs.

**Service writers**
Service writers are not required to be certified if they greet customers, initiate paperwork and do not perform diagnosis or repair. Diagnosis and repairs must be performed by properly certified mechanics.
 
**Collision shop estimators**
Collision shop estimators are required to be certified in Unitized Body Structural Repair if the estimate they are writing includes repair or replacement of any components that effect the structural integrity of a vehicle. This also includes determining if no structural repairs are necessary.
 
To obtain a certification, you will need to complete and pass a mechanic test for each category of repair you plan to perform. You may also obtain a mechanic trainee permit to work under the supervision of a properly certified mechanic.
 
Mechanic tests are offered electronically at all Secretary of State offices. You may pre-register and pay the testing fee in advance through Online Services. It is recommended that you also schedule your Secretary of State visit in advance.
 
Note: Allow 30 days for processing of your application. If you are a registered mechanic, or have been registered in the past, you will need to create an online Secretary of State account to renew or reinstate your certificate.
 
**ASE certification
**Even if you have successfully passed exams issued by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), you must be state certified to perform repairs in Michigan. However, you may be eligible to apply for state certification and transfer ASE categories of repair to your mechanic certification in lieu of taking the state certification exams. Check the ASE Exam Conversion Table for applicable ASE categories.
 
To provide proof of ASE certification, you will need to have your myASE account generate a status letter directly to the Business Licensing Section before you apply for state certification. To generate a status letter:
 
Mechanic trainees can apply to train under the direct supervision of a certified mechanic without obtaining certification themselves. Each trainee permit category is only valid for 2 years and is nonrenewable, so it is recommended that the trainee only apply for those categories of repair that they will be actively training in.
 
As a mechanic trainee, you may only perform repairs in the categories authorized on your permit and with a mechanic who is also certified in these same repair categories. You must display your permit at the licensed facility where you are training and ensure that it is visible to customers.
 
A mechanic trainee permit is valid for a period of **two years** from the date of issue in the major repair categories listed on the permit.**A permit may not be renewed**. A trainee permit may only be re-issued if you are unable to meet the certification requirements in the areas of Engine Tune-up/Performance, Electrical Systems, and Brakes and Braking Systems provided you have not held a trainee permit in those categories in the past three years.
 
You can renew your certificate up to 60 days in advance of its expiration. Ahead of your certificate expiration date, the Michigan Department of State will send you a renewal form by mail. Box 4 of your mechanic certificate renewal form will list the certificate expiration date. 

Your new certificate should arrive in the mail within three weeks after your application has been processed. When you receive your new mechanic certificate, you are required to post it prominently where customers can review it.
 
Your new certificate should arrive in the mail within two weeks after your application has been processed. When you receive your new mechanic certificate, post it prominently where customers can review it.

You are able to add a separate mailing address for your mechanic account if you want only your mechanic related mail to go to a different address.

**IMPORTANT:** A mechanic mailing address will be active until it is removed. If you change your driver's license address and do not remove the mechanic mailing address, your mechanic mail will still go to the mailing address. If you have used a mailing address in the past, and are not receiving mechanic related mail, you should log into your e-Services account and verify that your addresses are correct. You can also contact Business Licensing at Licensing@michigan.gov.

If you are an automotive and light truck mechanic certified in Engine Tune-up/Performance, Electrical Systems or Brakes and Braking Systems, you must comply with one of the following requirements for continuing certification. Certificates in the three categories noted are good for five years and must be renewed before their expiration date. All other repair categories do not require recertification.
 
Certain test categories require recertification every five years. If you are certified in one of the Auto/Light Truck categories that follows, you must comply with the recertification requirement before your certification expiration date, according to the schedule that follows:
 
The Michigan Department of State is responsible for licensing, registering, certifying, and regulating vehicle dealers, repair facilities, and mechanics to assure that they adhere to the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Service and Repair Act 300 of 1974.
 
The Michigan Motor Vehicle Service and Repair Act requires that mechanics performing motor vehicle maintenance, diagnosis, vehicle body work, or repair service on a motor vehicle for compensation must be certified by the Michigan Department of State for the types of repairs they will perform. The Business Compliance and Regulation Division is responsible for overseeing the certification of mechanics and has the authority to deny, suspend, or revoke a license or certification if the licensee or applicant has not complied with state law. Mechanics may receive a written warning, be placed on probation, be fined, or have their license suspended or revoked if the actions cannot be resolved.
 
**IMPORTANT: BAIID certification is a process requiring sponsorship by a BAIID manufacturer. A Michigan-approved BAIID manufacturer must submit your completed BAIID installer application on your behalf. Your application will not be processed if not submitted by a manufacturer.**
 
You must have a specialty certification to install, calibrate, remove, or manipulate a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) in Michigan. BAIID-certified mechanics are only authorized to perform these functions at a registered repair facility (or approved 12-volt facility) that is associated with a State of Michigan-approved BAIID manufacturer.
 
If you are not a Michigan-certified mechanic, you will need to complete and submit a Mechanic Certification Application and payment before your sponsoring BAIID manufacturer submits the BAIID Installer Application on your behalf.
 
There is no additional fee for a BAIID Installer Certificate, and it will be associated to the same number as your Mechanic Certificate. Replacement Installer Certificates can be requested by contacting the Business Licensing Section at Licensing@Michigan.gov or 888-767-6424. 


 
Your BAIID installer certificate, once approved, will align with the expiration date of your mechanic certificat
