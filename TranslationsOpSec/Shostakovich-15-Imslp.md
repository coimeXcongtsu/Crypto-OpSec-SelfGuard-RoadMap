I have notice in some of the other threads some other member of Violinist do some sort of exchange in music? If this is possible I could use Hindemith Violin Concerto (Solo Part), Mathis der Maler (Comp. Opera) Violin 1. Prokofiev Semyon Kotko (Violin 1) Or Romeo and Juliet (Violin 1) and Shostakovich Symphony No. 11 and 12. Thanks!

October 26, 2010 at 11:30 PM Or more likely can only be hired rather than bought (unless you're a professional orchestra perhaps). However, it may be possible to borrow the parts from the music department of some of the larger public libraries. I think an inter-library loan system may exist. Anyway, it's worth following up.
 
The violin/piano reduction of the Hindemith concerto is published by Schott and can be purchased online or special ordered from your local store (I doubt many actually keep the music in stock). All of the orchestral parts are indeed rentals, although I've never heard of someone renting a single part - its usually the entire set of performance parts that get rented by orchestras. Then again, I've never contacted a publisher about the possibility of renting a single part, maybe some will?
 
October 28, 2010 at 10:41 AM Thank's for these suggestions, but however I am aware of all the circumstances with 20th Century music. I kinda figured if some who has performed these works and kept an neat photo copy of the work and who's willing to share or do some sort of exchange. Thanks for these suggestions. And yes imslp.org is a superb resource for music that is pd status in the US!
 
October 28, 2010 at 10:59 AM @Christina C. Would you be willing to elaborate? I've always thought works that are still under copyright were only limited to those being professional or amateur and yth orchestra who need to perform them. Can an individual rent a single part? I've never heard of this, this is really interesting!

I don't believe you'd be able to rent just part of a set. If I struck out in my online search for something like this, my next stop would be the local university library, but for you that depends on whehter you have one near you with a decent music programme & library.
 
October 28, 2010 at 07:23 PM Just a point of information--even if you located some parts that were purchased prior to GATT extending the copyright of Russian works, it would still be illegal to photocopy the parts for your personal use. If this is music for an audition, I would suggest contacting the group to see if they had music that was available for your use.
 
October 28, 2010 at 09:12 PM Would there be copyright infringement if you got hold of a published score, say from a public library, and manually copied, in pencil or ink, your relevant instrument parts onto manuscript paper, perhaps ignoring editorial matter other than that of the composer, and putting in your own fingering, bowing, and phrasing (thereby generating your own copyright in your "arrangement")? It has the great advantage that when you've done the copying you'll be very familiar with the music even before you start practicing it.
[BTW, I'm not using "you" in reference to any particular individual but rather in the more general sense of the pronoun "one"]
 
October 29, 2010 at 08:42 AM Thanks for the suggestion. I can give that a go. But I'm very particular and very neat when it comes to having a clear and clean copy of a part. Maybe one can come up with a scheme or copy the score completely or pdf them and copy and past..
 
October 29, 2010 at 11:19 AM I have a question for Jim (or anyone else who may know the answer). Say my university's orchestra has a part for a work now under copyright again because of GATT (say Shostakovich Symphony #5), which they would loan me for a short period. If I copy it for my use to practice the part at home for a couple weeks until the orchestra hands out the music for the concert, how is that not covered under the "fair use" clause in the copyright laws? I can see an orchestra using photocopies for a performance (with an admission price especially) being a problem, but using a copy for one's own use? How is that different from when I copy journal articles from the library for my private use, which is covered un the "fair use" clause?
 
October 29, 2010 at 12:52 PM And who is going to know you've copied it for your own personal and private use? You'll just turn up at the dress rehearsal and concert and apparently sight-read to perfection the printed copy placed on your stand :-)
 
Another thing: in my area there is a full-time professional chamber ensemble of about a dozen players who sometimes give a 90-minute concert entirely from memory. They play standing, except for the two cellists, facing the audience in a flattened semicircle with the director/leader at one end of the line. Very impressive to watch and listen to. But where would copyright come into the equation in these circumstances?
 
October 30, 2010 at 03:59 PM I am away from the office right now, so I won't quote you chapter and verse, but my understanding of your specific scenario is that the University (orchestra) who purchased the music prior to copyright being reinstated by GATT is the only one who has the rights to perform from this previously PD piece. They cannot make copies even for their own use if they loose something like the 1st Oboe part, and want to make a hand copy of the missing part off the score, so that is why orchestras are so leary of loaning music like this to other orchestras. In addition, the rights associated with owning the parts does not allow them to transfer that right (if they loan the music to another group) even if they own the music legally. If the parts ARE loaned to another group, the latter is still liable for payment of the rental fees to the publisher. Photocopies used for performance are not legal. What is allowed (at least from my understanding from MOLA discussions--Major Orchestra Librarian Association) is that an orchestra needs to have 1 original part per stand, and having a photocopy for the standpartner to prepare outside of rehearsal is "probably" allowed. But the orchestra also has the obligation to destroy those photocopies after the performance.
