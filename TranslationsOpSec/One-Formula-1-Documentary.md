While the plot itself has garnered some criticism over the years, it is the racing that makes it one of director John Frankenheimer's biggest hits. Partially filmed at tracks during actual F1 race weekends, Grand Prix combines nostalgia for the golden age of motorsport with racing sequences that stand up against even its most technically advanced modern counterparts. This is the classic - it is a must-see for all F1 fans.

The story of Bruce McLaren is told through new dramatized footage alongside the original film and supported by interviews with those who knew him. What is most striking about the documentary is it makes clear the astounding dedication and loyalty he inspired in those who worked for him on his journey from humble beginnings in New Zealand to the top echelon of motorsport. As McLaren continues to fight back from a tough couple of years in the present, the journey of its pioneering founder continues to be poignant.
 
1. Life on the Limit has the ultimate bragging rights when it comes to interviews, with a plethora of racing stars from John Surtees to Lewis Hamilton having their say on the dangers of motorsport past and present. The journey from the early days of racing to modern F1 has been a long one and the fight to improve safety measures has been just as lengthy. Combining rare and archival footage, the documentary emphasises just how difficult it is to balance safety and thrills in a sport that is inherently dangerous.
 
Ron Howard's cinematic recreation of the 1976 F1 season is worth a watch for both F1 fans and non-fans alike. Rush perfectly captures the intensity of the battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda for the title while remaining unafraid to delve into the sheer brutality of Lauda's recovery after his life-changing crash at the Nurburgring. This film has all the Hollywood glamour (starring Marvel Cinematic Universe stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl as Hunt and Lauda respectively) but that does not take away from its racing spirit.
 
More than anything, Williams is an intimate look into the heart of the Williams family. A combination of new and archive footage tells the story all the way from Frank Williams founding the team to his daughter Claire taking hold of the reigns today. At the focus is Virginia Williams, wife of Frank and mother of Claire, and the part she played in the family's success. Interviews with Nigel Mansell and Sir Patrick Head, among others, helps to bring the tale of a true family business alive.
 
Roman Polanski had the good fortune to be close friends with Sir Jackie Stewart, making his 1971 documentary covering Stewart's Monaco Grand Prix weekend a real insight. With so much access to the star himself the documentary gives fans a window into life as a racing driver during a grand prix, from the seriousness of racing to light-hearted moments of fun. For those wanting to be a fly on the wall of a world champion, now is your chance.

Tommy Byrne has dropped out of the public consciousness but Crash and Burn is doing its best to reverse that. The Irish racer was once mentioned in the same breath as Ayrton Senna and this film considers the reasons he never became a household name. The inaccessibility and snobbery of F1 takes a kicking, as does Byrne's fiery temper and the culmination is a potential unfulfilled. The film leaves you with no doubt that it was a loss to the entire motorsport world that this colourful character could never find his fit in the shiny world of F1.
 
Ferrari: Race to Immortality documents the golden era of the 1950s when Ferrari was rising to prominence. Tragedy and triumph occur side by side with Enzo Ferrari at the centre building his empire. By telling the story of how Ferrari became legendary, the documentary highlights the team's rich motorsport history, from cinematic drama to heartbreak and success tinted with sadness.
 
There's no one in motorsport who captures the imagination quite like Ayrton Senna. This documentary covers his life from 1984 to his death in 1994, making use of an abundance of previously unseen footage. Everybody knows what happened that weekend in Imola but following Senna through a decade of his life makes its sudden end shocking and deeply moving. Senna is gone but not forgotten, and the success of this documentary shows how much of an appetite there still is for an insight into legend.
 
The Motorsport Network's very first film commission comes from acclaimed writer of Senna, Manish Pandey.

Juan Manuel Fangio is often heralded as one of the best to ever grace a Formula 1 track, however, with his final F1 race being over 60 years ago, the story behind the name is comparatively little-known. This documentary aims to shed light on that story, covering both his racing career and his life in general through archive footage, interviews with his contemporaries and competitors, as well as what he did after racing. For people who want to know why Fangio is cited as one of the best, this is a must.
 
***Formula 1: Drive to Survive*** is a television documentary series produced in a collaboration between Netflix and Formula One, to give a behind-the-scenes look at the drivers and races of the Formula One World Championship. The series has received one season per year since 2019, and a total of six seasons have been released, with the latest season aired on 23 February 2024. A crossover event with *Full Swing* broadcast on Netflix in November 2023 called *The Netflix Cup*.
 
On 24 March 2018, Formula One announced that Netflix had commissioned a ten episode docu-series giving an exclusive behind the scenes look at the 2018 Formula One World Championship.[1][2] On 24 July 2019, Formula One announced that a second season would premiere in 2020 covering the 2019 Formula One World Championship, involving all 10 teams.[3][4]
 
Gay-Rees subsequently went on to reveal to *The Fast Lane Podcast* that *Drive to Survive* had originally been conceived as a series revolving solely around Red Bull Racing before it evolved into a series about F1 in general.[6]
 
The show has received recognition for the additional insight it offers fans,[9] and is credited with attracting new audiences (particularly American) to the sport.[10][11][12] The condensing of season-long themes into single-episode narratives has drawn praise for adapting "the natural drama of a racing season into a narrative that can encourage a fan to tune into the real thing."[13]
 
However, *Drive to Survive* has been criticized for including fake or misplaced commentary and team radios,[13][14][15][16] staging certain scenes,[13][17][18] placing undue importance on test and practice sessions,[16][17] and over-dramatizing or misrepresenting certain events and relationships within the Formula One paddock.[14][16][19] The continued criticism from both audiences and drivers led to discussions between Netflix and team managers and between Formula One and drivers.[20]
 
Max Verstappen notably refused to participate in interviews for seasons 3 and 4 as he believed that the show dramatized some drivers by portraying them as villains and that the show manufactured fake rivalries.[21][22][23] However, Verstappen confirmed his participation in season 5 after reaching an agreement with the producers to "keep it real".[23][24][25]
 
In 2020, a series similar to *Drive to Survive* was released on F1 TV based on the 2019 Formula 2 Championship, called *Chasing the Dream*.[44] Subsequent second and third seasons were produced, each covering the 2020 and 2021 F2 Championships, premiering in 2021 and 2022 respectively.[45][46] The fourth and fifth seasons, based on the 2022 and 2023 F2 Championships, were released on F1 TV as well as free-to-air on YouTube during the respective years.[47][48] Other motorsports have jumped on the "Drive to Survive Train" with Formula E, NASCAR and IndyCar all showing their own respective docuseries.

Yet for all its failings, including a complete inability to ever field two cars that could run properly, and similar difficulties when it came to paying bills, somehow this ragtag team managed to qualify for a race - in Monaco, of all places.
 
That was the only highlight of a season that was cut short when mysterious team boss Andrea Sassetti was arrested in the Belgian GP paddock later in the season. Despite attempts to be let into the paddock next time out at Monza, and even filing an entry for 1993, the team was never seen again.
 
In the three decades since, the Andrea Moda story has become a legendary oddball tale. Its failure effectively represented the end of hopeless chancers taking a shot at F1, and the shambolic stories of what went on in the team that year have become iconic.
 
Caffi (above) comes off as charming and not at all bitter about the nightmare situation he managed to extract himself from, while McCarthy delivers his classic one-liners in a style you can tell has been perfected over many years.
 
The first official feature documentary about Formula One racing legend Michael Schumacher is in the final stages of production, with award-winning German film
