This is the list of 10 required practicals that you must include on the 4psow. The reason you have to do these is that there will be a question on paper 3 that related to one of them. There are many ways of doing these experiments so the question will have to be on general experimental techniques rather than the specifics.

Custom made ball dropping apparatus (e.g. PASCO) (I only have 2 so do this as part of a circus of experiments)
Electric kettle and thermometer plus top pan balance (class set, I actually use a temp. sensor)
Datalogger (e.g. Vernier or PASCO) + pressure sensor and attachments (class set, although the measurements are very quick so students could rotate around one set)
Drinking straws (Audacity software)
Glass block and ray lamp (or use my photos and onscreen protractor) (I only have one block so my students used my ready made photos)
Laser plus Double slits (e.g PASCO) (I have 6 lasers but only two sets of slits)
Pencil and paper plus multimeter (class set)
Multimeter, Nichrome wire and battery plus holder (class set)
Paul falstads circuit simulation
Measuring cylinder and beer plus loggerPro video analysis software or pencil and paper. (I borrow the cylinder from Chem. lab many video the same one, saves wasting too much beer)
 
Effective A level practical work: physics will provide you with a range of both practical and pedagogical experience to support practical science in your subject. You will build the disciplinary knowledge required to teach practical work and investigate a joined-up approach to progression across the curriculum. We will also look at developing concepts through practical work and how to build student understanding towards practical work questions.
 
Robin and Thomas are joined by Rajani Nair (@NairPhysics) who answered a Twitter call about A-level required practicals and was whisked in front of a microphone to talk to us. If you fancy coming on to talk about an aspect of physics teaching, just drop us a line in the contact form below.

I am a retired Physics Teacher from Coimbatore, India. Yours is one of the best set of videos on A level physics experiments. The quality of the video and the way concepts are presented are indeed excellent.
 
To be considered, you must meet (or be predicted to meet) the minimum requirements for the programme you are interested in. Given the competition for places, we recommend you only apply to programmes where you meet these requirements.
 
For entry to our undergraduate degree programmes, UCL does not use UCAS tariff points to assess applications. Instead, we use specific qualification and grade requirements to assess your eligibility.
 
The Engineering Foundation Year programme is for students who are traditionally underrepresented at UCL. The entry requirements for this programme are 100 UCAS tariff points from level 3 academic qualifications.
 
Our entrance requirements are based on three A Levels. If you are studying more than three A Levels, we will consider your three highest grades. We will include any required or preferred subjects as appropriate. Any offer will only consist of three A Level grades.
 
You should offer at least two A Levels taken from the preferred A Level subjects list below. Your third A Level can be in any other subject. If you do not have two preferred subjects, please contact the admissions team to check if we can consider your application.
 
If you have studied A levels at an accelerated rate, and you have therefore completed this study alongside your GCSE level study, we may stipulate the A levels you are currently studying in your offer conditions.
 
UCL recognises the value of EPQs as preparation for independent study, which is key to university-level study. If your EPQ topic is related to the UCL programme you are applying to, you may wish to discuss this in your personal statement.
 
In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, reforms to AS and A Levels and GCSEs began in September 2015, with different subjects being phased in over the subsequent two years. For universities, one of the key challenges is the mixture of qualifications that an applicant may present. Not only are the constituent countries of the UK providing different styles of existing qualifications, but as subjects are phased in, we are seeing applicants offering a mixture of both old and new style GCSEs and A Levels.
 
We look at each applicant on an individual basis, but the reference is key in explaining the teaching within the school to the admissions selector. We ask referees to provide a clear explanation of any restrictions or difficulties the applicants may have faced in terms of funding and subject availability, along with an explanation of the styles of GCSE/A levels they have taken.
 
With the introduction of curriculum reforms, we understand that it will be more difficult for teachers to predict final grades in the initial year of study. In the past, AS modules have been useful as an indication of a student's level of achievement and likelihood to achieve their prediction. As this information will no longer be available, we will be more reliant on applicants' past academic history and references. We would also encourage referees to comment on an applicant's level of achievement in the end of year 12 examinations where these have been held, and to provide a picture of the applicant's progress through both GCSE and A Level study.
 
The Core Mathematics qualification does not form part of our standard entrance requirements, but UCL welcomes the opportunity for students to be able to continue their mathematics studies. For programmes where GCSE Mathematics is required at grade 6 (or grade B), Core Mathematics will be accepted as a supplement to grade 5 (or grade C) at GCSE.
 
We require at least three subjects at Higher Level. If you are studying more than three Higher Level subjects, we will consider your three highest grades. We will also include any required or preferred subjects as appropriate.
 
Our entrance requirements are based on three Pre-U principal subjects. If you are studying more than three Pre-U principal subjects, we will consider your three highest grades. We will also include any required or preferred subjects as appropriate. Any offer will only consist of three Pre-U principal subject grades.
 
We consider the WBQ Advanced Skills Challenge Certificate plus two A Level grades as meeting our requirements. Your grade in the WBQ Advanced Skills Challenge Certificate is considered as directly equivalent to an A Level grade.
 
The WJEC Level 3 Applied Diploma in Criminology is only accepted for entry to the BSc Crime and Security Science programme, and the Engineering Foundation Year programmes. This qualification is not accepted for any other programme at UCL.
 
UCL considers the UAL Level 3 Extended Diploma in Art and Design, with the final overall mark of Distinction, to meet the entry requirements for the Fine Art (BA and BFA) and Architecture programmes only.
 
The UAL Level 3 Extended Diploma in Creative Practice: Art, Design and Communications with the final overall mark of Distinction is considered to meet the entry requirements for Fine Art (BA and BFA) and Architecture programmes (for 2025 entry).
 
We usually look for all qualifications to be from one suite (e.g., three A Levels, or an IB Diploma). However, we understand that some applicants may offer a combination of level 3 qualifications. We accept a mix of A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U or a mix of A Levels and Advanced Highers for all programmes.
 
Some programmes are willing to consider a mix of other acceptable qualifications on a case-by case basis. Please contact us for further advice before you apply, stating your qualifications and the programme you are interested in.
 
All programmes require a grade 5 or higher in English Language and Mathematics at GCSE or equivalent. Some programmes require higher grades or additional GCSE passes. Please check the requirements of each individual programme carefully.
 
Some schools, both in the UK and overseas, fast-track their students and limit the number of examinations they take. As a result, you may not be sitting some GCSE or equivalent qualifications. We will be pleased to consider your application on its individual merits.
 
Resits are generally considered for most of our programmes. Any programmes that do not consider resits will outline this on their department webpages. Where resits have been attempted more than once, this may put you at a disadvantage.
 
We do not have a mitigating circumstances form. UCL's policy is that such mitigating factors are a matter for the Exam Boards and should be considered at the time of the exams rather than retrospectively by the university.
 
We developed this scheme to provide **A Level students in Local Widening participation schools** the opportunity to fulfil their potential and expand their horizons. By providing access to excellent laboratory facilities and academic expertise we hope it will inspire confidence and lead to students wishing to study physics at undergraduate level
 
The scheme gives students from local schools the opportunity to perform the required A Level experiments here at Newcastle University. The scheme is open to schools which would fall into the Widening Participation category and others who do not have access to the required equipment.
 
There will be no charge for the scheme from the University. The school is expected to oversee the transport of students to and from the University, and to make any charges for this which they would normally do. Experiments are to be carried out within school hours, as this makes it very much easier to organise on both sides. We expect a teacher to be present and to lead the session.
 
Students will be encouraged to work in p
