Each of the 64 possible sets corresponds to a hexagram, which can be looked up in the *I Ching*. The hexagrams are arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the *I Ching* has been discussed and debated over the centuries. Many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision-making, as informed by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and been paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wu Xing.
 
The name *Zhou yi* literally means the 'changes' (易; *y*) of the Zhou dynasty. The 'changes' involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams, of their lines, or of the numbers obtained from the divination.[8] Feng Youlan proposed that the word for 'changes' originally meant 'easy', as in a form of divination easier than the oracle bones, but there is little evidence for this. There is also an ancient folk etymology that sees the character for 'changes' as containing the sun and moon, the cycle of the day. Modern sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds, or from the content of a vessel being changed into another.[9]

The *Zhou yi* was traditionally ascribed to the Zhou cultural heroes King Wen of Zhou and the Duke of Zhou, and was also associated with the legendary world ruler Fuxi.[10] According to the canonical *Great Commentary*, Fuxi observed the patterns of the world and created the eight trigrams (八卦; *bāgu*), "in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things". The *Zhou yi* itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins.[11] The *Rites of Zhou*, however, also claims that the hexagrams of the *Zhou yi* were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams.[12] During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams.[13] Eventually, a consensus formed around 2nd-century AD scholar Ma Rong's attribution of the text to the joint work of Fuxi, King Wen of Zhou, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted.[14]
 
The basic unit of the *Zhou yi* is the hexagram (卦 gu), a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines (爻 yo). Each line is either broken or unbroken. The received text of the *Zhou yi* contains all 64 possible hexagrams, along with the hexagram's name (卦名 gumng), a short hexagram statement (彖 tun),[note 2] and six line statements (爻辭 yoc).[note 3] The statements were used to determine the results of divination, but the reasons for having two different methods of reading the hexagram are not known, and it is not known why hexagram statements would be read over line statements or vice versa.[16]
 
The book opens with the first hexagram statement, yun hēng l zhēn (元亨利貞). These four words are often repeated in the hexagram statements and were already considered an important part of *I Ching* interpretation in the 6th century BC. Edward Shaughnessy describes this statement as affirming an "initial receipt" of an offering, "beneficial" for further "divining".[17]The word zhēn (貞, ancient form ) was also used for the verb 'divine' in the oracle bones of the late Shang dynasty, which preceded the Zhou. It also carried meanings of being or making upright or correct, and was defined by the Eastern Han scholar Zheng Xuan as "to enquire into the correctness" of a proposed activity.[18]
 
The names of the hexagrams are usually words that appear in their respective line statements, but in five cases (2, 9, 26, 61, and 63) an unrelated character of unclear purpose appears. The hexagram names could have been chosen arbitrarily from the line statements,[19] but it is also possible that the line statements were derived from the hexagram names.[20] The line statements, which make up most of the book, are exceedingly cryptic. Each line begins with a word indicating the line number, "base, 2, 3, 4, 5, top", and either the number 6 for a broken line, or the number 9 for a whole line. Hexagrams 1 and 2 have an extra line statement, named *yong*.[21] Following the line number, the line statements may make oracular or prognostic statements.[22] Some line statements also contain poetry or references to historical events.[23]

Archaeological evidence shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent.[24] The *Zhou yi* provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, but it is not known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings.[25] In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The *Great Commentary* contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9.[26] Like the *Zhou yi* itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.[27]
 
The ancient narratives *Zuo Zhuan* and *Guoyu* contain the oldest descriptions of divination using the *Zhou yi*. The two histories describe more than twenty successful divinations conducted by professional soothsayers for royal families between 671 and 487 BC. The method of divination is not explained, and none of the stories employ predetermined commentaries, patterns, or interpretations. Only the hexagrams and line statements are used.[28] By the 4th century BC, the authority of the *Zhou yi* was also cited for rhetorical purposes, without relation to any stated divination.[29] The *Zuo Zhuan* does not contain records of private individuals, but Qin dynasty records found at Shuihudi show that the hexagrams were privately consulted to answer questions such as business, health, children, and determining lucky days.[30]
 
The most common form of divination with the *I Ching* in use today is a reconstruction of the method described in these histories, in the 300 BC *Great Commentary*, and later in the *Huainanzi* and the *Lunheng*. From the *Great Commentary*'s description, the Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi reconstructed a method of yarrow stalk divination that is still used throughout the Far East. In the modern period, Gao Heng attempted his own reconstruction, which varies from Zhu Xi in places.[31] Another divination method, employing coins, became widely used in the Tang dynasty and is still used today. In the modern period; alternative methods such as specialized dice and cartomancy have also appeared.[32]
 
In the *Zuo Zhuan* stories, individual lines of hexagrams are denoted by using the genitive particle zhi (之), followed by the name of another hexagram where that specific line had another form. In later attempts to reconstruct ancient divination methods, the word zhi was interpreted as a verb meaning 'moving to', an apparent indication that hexagrams could be transformed into other hexagrams. However, there are no instances of "changeable lines" in the *Zuo Zhuan*. In all 12 out of 12 line statements quoted, the original hexagrams are used to produce the oracle.[33]
 
In 136 BC, Emperor Wu of Han named the *Zhou yi* "the first among the classics", dubbing it the *Classic of Changes* or *I Ching*. Emperor Wu's placement of the *I Ching* among the Five Classics was informed by a broad span of cultural influences that included Confucianism, Taoism, Legalism, yin-yang cosmology, and Wu Xing physical theory.[34] While the *Zhou yi* does not contain any cosmological analogies, the *I Ching* was read as a microcosm of the universe that offered complex, symbolic correspondences.[35] The official edition of the text was literally set in stone, as one of the Xiping Stone Classics.[36] The canonized *I Ching* became the standard text for over two thousand years, until alternate versions of the *Zhou yi* and related texts were discovered in the 20th century.[37]
 
Part of the canonization of the *Zhou yi* bound it to a set of ten commentaries called the Ten Wings. The Ten Wings are of a much later provenance than the *Zhou yi*, and are the production of a different society. The *Zhou yi* was written in Early Old Chinese, while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese.[38] The specific origins of the Ten Wings are still a complete mystery to academics.[39] Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the *I Ching* a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship.[40] The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the *Zuo zhuan* and other pre-Han texts, that the *I Ching* was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.[41]
 
Arguably the most important of the Ten Wings is the *Great Commentary* (*Dazhuan*) or *Xi ci*, which dates to roughly 300 BC.[note 4] The *Great Commentary* describes the *I Ching* as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the *I Ching*, the *Great Commentary* states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe.[26] Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations.[42
