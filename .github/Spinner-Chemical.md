Spin chemistry concerns phenomena such as chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP), chemically induced electron polarization (CIDEP), magnetic isotope effects in chemical reactions, and it is hypothesized to be key in the underlying mechanism for avian magnetoreception[1] and consciousness.[2]
 
The radical-pair mechanism explains how a magnetic field can affect reaction kinetics by affecting electron spin dynamics. Most commonly demonstrated in reactions of organic compounds involving radical intermediates, a magnetic field can speed up a reaction by decreasing the frequency of reverse reactions.

A radical is a molecule with an odd number of electrons, and is induced in a variety of ways, including ultra-violet radiation. A sun burn is largely due to radical formation from this radiation. The radical-pair, however, is not simply two radicals. This is because radical-pairs (specifically singlets) are quantum entangled, even as separate molecules.[1] More fundamental to the radical-pair mechanism, however, is the fact that radical-pair electrons both have spin, short for spin angular momentum, which gives each separate radical a magnetic moment. Therefore, spin states can be altered by magnetic fields.
 
Spin states relate to chemical and biochemical reaction mechanisms because bonds can be formed only between two electrons of opposite spin (Hund's rules). Sometimes when a bond is broken in a particular manner, for example, when struck by photons, each electron in the bond relocates to each respective molecule, and a radical-pair is formed. Furthermore, the spin of each electron previously involved in the bond is conserved,[1][3] which means that the radical-pair now formed is a singlet (each electron has opposite spin, as in the origin bond). As such, the reverse reaction, i.e. the reforming of a bond, called recombination, readily occurs. The radical-pair mechanism explains how external magnetic fields can prevent radical-pair recombination with Zeeman interactions, the interaction between spin and an external magnetic field, and shows how a higher occurrence of the triplet state accelerates radical reactions because triplets can proceed only to products, and singlets are in equilibrium with the reactants as well as with the products.[1][3][4]
 
Because the Zeeman interaction is a function of magnetic field and Larmor frequency, it can be obstructed or amplified by altering the external magnetic or the Larmor frequency with experimental instruments that generate oscillating fields. It has been observed that migratory birds lose their navigational abilities in such conditions where the Zeeman interaction is obstructed in radical-pairs.[1]
 
The Nanopatterning Cleanroom has four wet benches each dedicated to specific chemical processing applications. The spinner bench features several hot plates that support e-beam lithography, including a custom triple resist hotplate designed and built by Tom Carver that has a Teflon coated precision flat surface with uniform and accurate surface temperatures. The solvent bench opposite the spinner bench supports various cleaning and liftoff processes and features a sonicator bath. The base and acid benches are used for chemical processing with alkaline and acidic substances respectively. The Nanopatterning Cleanroom provides users with a variety of general use chemicals, and also supports the use of external, user-supplied chemicals upon staff approval.

Please note that subsequent training may be required after the initial Wet Bench Training depending on what processing you plan on doing. Before you start any new processes after completing the initial Wet Bench Training, contact staff at nano-snpcleanroom-staff@lists.stanford.edu to check if further guidance or training may be required.

Amongst the different versions of this song (Known by various names including "The Chemical Worker's Song", "Process Man" and "The ICI Song") that are floating around, there seem to be two variations of the second verse.
 
I have a feeling spitters might be propagated from a transcription error in the Great Big Sea recording, in which it is **very** difficult to distinguish the sound as n or t, (they may even be singing "spitters"). But I was curious to know if it was a variation that had some other legitimate meaning.
 
There was no variance in the lyrics until the cover published by Great Big Sea in the 1995 release of their UP album. That version contained an ambiguous pronunciation at the 55 second mark. Although some of Great Big Sea's live versions moved back to the original spinners, the ambiguity circulated by their popular album impacted subsequent covers of the song. Some artists move back to the original spinners, while others proliferate spitters. The published lyrics seem to suggest that spitters has overcome spinners, and even karaoke lyrics associated with Great Big Sea's version use spitters.
 
It is often true that ambiguity adds value to poetry and lyrics. Since the nylon spinners of the mid 1900s are outside the context of 21st century listeners, spitters offers a more appealing visual of machines, factories and disgusted factory workers spewing out pollution and poison.
 
The original lyric was, spinners. There was a nylon plant at Billingham ICI ( the plant that the song was originally written about) that produced nylon yarn. Ronnie always sang spinners when he sang his song, I should know because he was a very good friend of mine and I had the great misfortune to have to work at the plant. The song says it all
 
They have led to the award of a major research grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council allowing the research team to expand on their discoveries in collaboration with industry.
 
The idea is based on flow chemistry, in which chemical reactions take place continuously in a flowing stream of liquid within a tube or a pipe, as opposed to more traditional "batch production" methods when chemicals are added into a vessel such as a flask and the product is then collected.
 
The addition of catalysts into a flow system can improve the reaction, but the team from the School of Chemistry have been searching for ways to improve the mixing of chemicals without comprising on factors such as reactivity and selectivity.
 
In their study, Professor Rudolf Allemann and Professor Thomas Wirth investigated a method known as high-performance counter current chromatography (HPCCC) in which chemicals and catalysts are spun around in a small tube.
 
Commenting on the findings, Professor Wirth said: "The novel use of an HPCCC machine for super-efficient mixing is very exciting. We can now speed up reactions through rapid mixing and get fast access to important chemical compounds. As big versions of these machines exist, the industrial use of the effects unraveled by our research groups is within reach."
 
One might be tempted to judge the ubiquitous fidget spinner, twirled endlessly between the fingers of school kids, as a mere toy. However, it has an unforeseen beneficial purpose, says a team of researchers. The device can act as a makeshift centrifuge, able to separate blood plasma to 99% purity. Just a couple of flicks of the spinner were sufficient to get enough pure plasma to test for HIV (*Anal. Chem*. 2018, DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04860).
 
**CORRECTION:** This article was updated on Feb. 7, 2019, to reflect that the blood samples were spiked with an HIV-1 protein commonly used in HIV diagnosis, not the complete HIV-1, and to clarify that the tubes used were plastic
 
The wet bench facilities are made of polypropylene; therefore, they are compatible with high temperature RCA processing, including hydrofluoric acid. The wet bench includes an aspirator and an automatic drain. The bench is connected to an acid neutralization system which makes it easier to dispose of RCA chemicals.
 
The microscope is used to verify lithography patterns after development, as well as the cleanliness of the substrate. It has a CCD camera so the user can see the details on the computer. It can offer a Pseudo 3D view (Nomarski Prism).
 
The MA1000 dicing saw allows for the dicing of pre- and post-fabricated wafers and samples up to a maximum diameter of 150 mm. The system is computer controlled, but the user is required to program the dicing parameters. Samples can be aligned using a built-in microscope; however, alignment features need to be spaced 50 mm apart.
 
The spin rinse drier is available for rinsing and cleaning whole four-inch wafers that fit in a standard cassette. The outlet water pH is monitored, and therefore the rinse process can be directly controlled by the program. Additionally, wafers can be heated while spinning to ensure completely dried and residue free cassette and wafers.
 
**SHIPPING SAVINGS SUGGESTION:** If you are ordering 5 Gallon Pails, or any chemicals exceeding 51 pounds per container, shipping rates may be more economical if you order comparable volumes in smaller package size. Our UPS wholesale prices are directly connected to the shopping cart, and any package over 50 pounds will incur a large package fee from UPS. For example, instead of ordering a pail of pre-spray, try 4 jars/gallons instead. The smaller packaging may save you shipping costs during checkout. :-
