Industrial Biotechnology is a comparably young field which comes along with high expectations with regard to sustainability issues. These stem from the promise of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and replacing fossil resources in the near or later future and using green technology, i.e. more environmentally friendly technologies. The intended economic, ecological and social benefits, however, need to be proven, resulting in a variety of challenges, both from a methodological and application point of view.
 
In this book, specific assessment and application topics of industrial biotechnology are addressed, highlighting challenges and solutions for both developers and users of assessment methods. In twelve chapters, experts in their particular fields define the scope, characterize industrial biotechnology and show in their contributions the state of the art, challenges and prospects of assessing industrial biotechnology products and processes.

The book provides an excellent introduction to industrial biotechnology, addressing the applications of biomolecules and living systems in industrial manufacturing of various products. Each part of the book is devoted to a certain biotech sector, such as biofuels, food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and materials. The book also covers the environmental aspects of industrial biotechnology and the principles of bio-based economy.
 
Advances in the fundamental knowledge surrounding biotechnology, novel materials, and advanced engineering approaches continue to be translated into bioprocesses that bring new products to market at a significantly faster pace than most other industries. Industrial scale biotechnology and new manufacturing methods are revolutionizing medicine, environmental monitoring and remediation, consumer products, food production, agriculture, and forestry, and continue to be a major area of research.
 
The downstream stage in industrial biotechnology refers to recovery, isolation, and purification of the microbial products from cell debris, processing medium and contaminating biomolecules from the upstream process into a finished product such as biopharmaceuticals and vaccines.

Downstream process design has the greatest impact on overall biomanufacturing cost because not only does the biochemistry of different products ( e.g., peptides, proteins, hormones, antibiotics, and complex antigens) dictate different methods for the isolation and purification of these products, but contaminating byproducts can also reduce overall process yield, and may have serious consequences on clinical safety and efficacy. Therefore downstream separation scientists and engineers are continually seeking to eliminate, or combine, unit operations to minimize the number of process steps in order to maximize product recovery at a specified concentration and purity.
 
Ideal for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses on biomanufacturing, biochemical engineering, biopharmaceutical facility design, biochemistry, industrial microbiology, gene expression technology, and cell culture technology, *Downstream Industrial Biotechnology* is also a highly recommended resource for industry professionals and libraries.
 
Dr. Flickinger was Director of the University of Minnesota's Institute for Advanced Studies in Biological Process Technology, which was later renamed the Biotechnology Institute ), and a Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul. Prior to coming to Minnesota Dr. Flickinger was Director of the Fermentation Program at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland.
 
Dr. Flickinger received his academic training at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. (B.S. (1973) in microbial biochemistry; M.S. (1975) and Ph.D. (1977) in pharmaceutical biochemistry.) He did his postdoctoral work at the Laboratory for Renewable Resources Engineering in the School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University.

Accelerating advanced chemical manufacturing by industrializing biology candrive the rapid growth of an innovative U.S. bioeconomy. A substantial shareof economic output will be increasingly related to the development and useof biological materials and bio-based processes for both chemical productionand the development of new materials. The industrialization of biologycreates social, environmental, and financial advantages that combineeconomic growth with public benefits and better lives for our citizens.
 
Bio-based chemicals also are not entirely new, nor are they a historicartifact. Current global bio-based chemical and polymer production alreadyis estimated to be about 50 million tons each year.20Bioprocessing techniques such as fermentation, baking, and tanning have beenused throughout much of human history. In recent history, we have witnessedmajor advances made possible by techniques such as genetic engineering andthe development of the biotechnology industry.
 
Other recent studies confirm the rapid growth in the thriving markets forbio-based products. Data from Agilent Technologies show that U.S.business-to-business revenues from industrial biotechnology alone reached atleast $125 billion in 2012.2b Bio-based chemical applicationsaccounted for about $66 billion of that U.S. economic activity, whilebiofuels added another $30 billion. Lux Research estimates that industrialchemicals made through synthetic biology currently represent a $1.5 billionmarket and that this likely will expand at 15 to 25 percent annual growthrates for the foreseeable future.3 A recent U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA) report indicates that, by 2015, bio-based chemicals willmake up greater than 10 percent of the chemical market.
 
The markets for bio-based chemicals and industrial biotechnology for chemicalmanufacturing processes are growing roughly twice as fast as those inbiomedicine or agriculture (Figure2-1). They also reflect new structural market shifts asdecentralized production processes, i
