Hi
I just set up another network a few days ago using another IPtime wireless router. All routers basically have the exact same steps I outlined as I bought 3 different ones. I recommend to upgrade your firmware which worked for me when I had problems and also resetting your router. Push and hold the router with a Pen for 30 seconds and try the steps again

bro
i have a service provider which have given me some accounts to access internet through a satellite based system. now that setup is connected to iptime router wifi. so when i am logging into any one account through the router the wifi becomes open and any other device can be easily connected to it without password into the same account.
 
i want to configure router such that after logging in into the service providers account wifi network to be a closed one.and also to be able to access into more than 2 service provider accounts through one router at a time.

Hello
That message means the router is not connected to the modem properly. If you still get the error after properly connecting the 2 devices, there might be something wrong with the cable connecting the router to the modem.
 
hello! i have the iptime a604 router. i followed all the instructions and it says it was successful on the setup module, but when i try to connect it still shows up as the default iptime SSID with no password. any idea how to fix this? thank you for your helpful guide!
 

RESET 1. plug-in the power source . I cannot accentuate this further because even the same AC/DC adaptor with the same voltage and amplifier may NOT work, if it is NOT the one supplied with your router out-of-the-box //
 

RESET 2. one of the four-or-so LED lights on the front or top of your router would be blinking . ( CPU here means the CPU of the router and NOT your computer ) this means that the device is functioning only whether or not it has been connected .
 
When I reset my n604v it restarted perfectly and now when i try to access the router through 192.168.0.1, it asks for some sort of id, password and captcha verification. Cant figure out what to enter in these fields(except captcha).
 
I input the 192.168.0.1 and it is not working. I filled in the username and password and the lettersbut still kept taking me back. Im so frustrated. I want to lock it since my internet is slow. I have IPtime N704-V3. Please help.
 
1.firmware directly effects hardware of a device
2.and although all updates are meant in good-will to improve the whole apparatus
3.it is only wise to change it if it does not work on your current setting somehow
4.thus should not set it to update automatically .
 
in your case :
5.evidently it has automatically updated itself, and the new firmware is not working
6.so revert to initial factory settings, and go back to previous firmware version .
7.and if this does not work or you cannot access any settings, because of the new firmware
8.you have no alternative but to take it or send it for repair .
