MTK drivers enable communication between Windows OS and MediaTek devices, such as smartphones, feature phones, and tablets. They are essential for the proper functioning of these devices, as they allow the Windows OS to recognize and interact with the hardware components, such as the camera, display, and storage.
 
Without these drivers, the computer may fail to detect or identify the device as an unknown one. This can result in improper functioning, such as the inability to transfer files or data or connect to the internet through the computer.
 
MTK Drivers facilitate data transfer and offer support for advanced features such as debugging, bootloader unlocking, and flashing firmware or custom ROMs, making them necessary for developers and tech-savvy users seeking to personalize their devices.
 
In short, MediaTek drivers are essential for a computer to communicate with and identify MediaTek devices, enabling data transfer and information exchange. They are also crucial for the proper recognition and functioning of the device when connected to the computer.
 
MTK drivers refer to drivers that are specifically designed for MediaTek devices. They allow Windows OS to communicate and interact with a MediaTek-based device, facilitating data transfer and allowing the device to be recognized and function properly when connected to the computer. These drivers are essential for developers and power users who want to customize their devices. In addition, MTK Driver support advanced features such as debugging, unlocking the device's bootloader, and flashing firmware or custom ROMs.

The MTK Driver, designed for MediaTek devices, is compatible with all Windows operating systems, ranging from Windows XP to the newest Windows 11, and works on 32-bit and 64-bit computers. However, it is not supported by macOS or Linux operating systems.
 
The MTK Driver can be obtained for free as the MediaTek community officially releases it for use with MediaTek smartphones and tablets. Users can get suitable drivers for their devices from the MediaTek Support forums.
 
The MTK Driver is safe for computers, laptops, and MediaTek mobile devices. It is an official release from the MediaTek community so that users can use it confidently without any threat to the device.
 
The frequency of updates for the MTK Driver depends on various factors, including the MediaTek community's development schedule, the release of new versions of operating systems, and the identification of bugs or security issues. Generally, the MTK Driver is updated periodically to ensure compatibility with new devices and operating systems, fix bugs, and address security concerns.
 
The MTK Driver can be installed by downloading the .exe file and running it on your computer. The installation process is similar to that of a standard Windows application. Detailed instructions on how to properly install the driver can be found on the How to install the MTK Driver page.
 
Yes, MTK Driver supports SP Flash Tool. SP Flash Tool is a software application used to flash firmware onto Android smartphones and tablets that use MediaTek chipsets. The tool requires MTK Driver to be installed on the computer for it to communicate with the device.
 
Yes, the MTK Driver supports IMEI Write Tools such as MauiMeta and ModemMeta, which can be used to write IMEI numbers onto Android smartphones and tablets that use MediaTek chipsets. However, the tool requires the MTK Driver installed on the computer to communicate with the device.
 
The MTK Driver alone cannot remove FRP (Factory Reset Protection) from MediaTek devices. FRP is a security feature implemented by Google in the Android operating system to prevent unauthorized access to a device after resetting its factory settings. A combination of tools and methods is required to remove FRP from MediaTek devices. One common method is to use a flashing tool such as SP Flash Tool or Miracle Box and a firmware file with the FRP lock removed. The MTK Driver must be installed and properly configured on the computer to use these tools.
 
I wanted to install arch on my (Asus Rog Flow X13) and compile Rust with all 16 cores. Funnily enough they equipped this monster of a laptop with a flimsy Network Adapter such as MT7922.
It came with windows and WiFI was working properly there.
 
The adapter shows on lspci but as you'll see below the driver fails with error -5.
Since the laptop itself doesn't support wired connection I'm using tethering through a phone. I did update all packages and kernels.
 
I did see the mentioned thread and patch; I'll have to re-compile the kernel tho in order to patch it so i left it last for later today.
Regarding the versions, tried the current latest 6.4.1 (all kernels), then if I remember correctly 6.2.1 (all kernels)
 
The issue is I'll have to keep it patched which I'm never a fan of and never doing (even with the programs I'll build). 
Will ping on the upstream of MT79 so they get to put a solution on the official release.
 
Would it be possible to get driver support for the Mediatek MT7613E 5GHz Wifi Module? I have the WG1608 and only 2.4GHz is working in OpenWRT. I have gotten information from ZBT that the MT7613E module is used for 5GHz, but I cannot find the driver. If this could possibly be added to the kmod-mt76 package, or standalone driver that would be very helpful.
 
Thank you for the quick reply. Do you know where to find kmod-mt7663-firmware-ap? I can't find it in the packages, and doing a Google search is not finding anything either. I did find kmod-mt7615e and installed it. Please let me know if you have any information. Thanks
 
I am currently using 19.07.3 firmware to see if I can get 5GHz working on the WG1608. I need to use GoldenOrb firmware as I have a modem, but that is running 18.06, which it looks like these MT drivers are not compatible with. But if I can get 5GHz working in 19.07.3 that would be a start.
 
Hi all, so I hope this helps others experiencing issues with their wifi completely failing on ANY device using the MediaTek MT7921 driver. So today I found my laptop having no wireless, and Windows didn't even see the hardware in the device manager. I ended up connecting a dongle to my laptop and was able to do some searching. I found this to be an extremely common issue. It is however NOT a hardware failure, as much as it seems to be. While Windows doesn't show it in the device manager if you go to the system information panel, then go to hardware and networking, it will show as present. The Lenovo driver package is functional, I really don't know why HP doesn't do anything about this, this card is not new and the issues reported are also a little too long in the tooth for being so widespread, anyways, here's the link to the good driver:
 
Don't worry about it being a Lenovo driver package, it'll work fine. Then afterward, do a cold reboot (shut down your PC all the way and then press the power button) when it comes back up to Windows and you login in, you should be back online/ Hope this helps!
 
So, i brought "Hell" to myself when i tried to remove this ancient ralink driver when windows update and HP S.A didn't provide any update for bluetooth\* , I downloaded it manually from here, i removed "Mediatek driver" from Program and Features, then uninstalled from Device manager till then everything was going okay. But when i tried to install downloaded driver it said this -
 
Then suddenly " I saw Bluetooth icon in taskbar" Everything i did was to remove bluetooth drivers and it was wiped out too but just the second i did whole process it appeared in taskbar showing bluetooth is on (while i have no access to bluetooth since it was frozen > "UNCLICKABLE") and in device manager, driver is back again with 2 microsoft bluetooth enumerator!
 
thanx, after performing system restore (chose 1 week older when i had not paired my bluetooth headset) it did good because when i opened bluetooth it was working fine but again when i tried to connect my bluetooth headset it paired but said "drive error" then next moment i switched off headset and switched on again my audio player didn't show audio renderer in list to connect with bluetooth headset like earlier while in bluetooth devices headset was paired up, i figured that it is because bluetooth is not working normal
 
And again when i turned off bluetooth after failure and went back to desktop screen it showed me bluetooth icon in taskbar just like before! I wanna know why bluetooth is opening itself even when i closed it ? and unfortunately when i went to PC & devices>bluetooth to close , it was frozen like before AGAIN!

 
Removing unwanted bluetooth icon is fine but the issue is that whenver i try to remove bluetooth driver , the next moment bluetooth icon appears with drivers in device manager ! I downloaded new bluetooth driver but i can't install it because old one stuck in my system !
 
I would look at the man page for lsmod; to my unexperienced eye it sounds like the kernel module containing the driver is not loaded. I am guessing that is what UNCLAIMED refers to; no kernel driver is claiming this PCIe device as its responsibility.
 
Ah, that is what I was about to ask for, the PCI vendor and product id. It looks like it is a fairly new device; I am not seeing it in the public PCI ID database that everyone (at least in open source land) uses:
 -ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/14c3
 
While MT7921 is on the wiki page showing supported devices, I do not see MT7921**K** there; this could just be a case of out-of-date documentation, however, I do see this askUbuntu post als
