Our **traditional wallpaper** is screen printed by hand on coated paper for a luxe, hand-painted look and feel. We use eco-friendly ground paper that is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified and manufactured carbon neutral.
 
Our designs carry names because they all have interesting stories to convey about people and places that inspired us when creating them. The inspiration for both colour and design often comes from the Swedish landscape and the nature surrounding us.

By the time Crane designed The Peacock Garden in 1889, the British government had begun to regulate the use of arsenic in a variety of industries. Other manufacturers followed suit during the last decades of the 19th century until the presence of arsenic pigments in wallpaper became obsolete.
 
Since I updated to Windows 11 I've been having a weird issue. I'm not able to select a different wallpaper for each of my two monitors. In the Personalization>Background menu, upon right clicking on the image to display the context menu, if I select "Set for Desktop 2" it does not change anything. On the other hand if I select "Set for Desktop 1" it changes the background for both monitors. Please note that I have my dual monitor set to Extend and not duplicate.
 
Hover over the "desktop" app on the taskbar next to the magnifying glass. It should say "Desktop 1" & "New Desktop". Open a New Desktop and remove "Desktop 1". After I did this it worked for me. I hope it works for you too! :)
 
This fixed it for me. I went to windows 11 > Display Settings > disconnected all monitors but the main one, re-extended my 2nd monitor. Went into Display Settings > Personalization > Background > and then had the right-click option on a recent image to select monitor 1 or 2.
 
I had virtual desktops active. What I had to do was remove all the virtual desktops, then I was able to select the background for specific monitors using the right-click menu on Recent Images in Settings > Personalization > Background.
 
Of course, using this method, all virtual desktops need to have the same background setup, but that works fine for me. I couldn't find a way to set backgrounds for individual monitors and different virtual desktops.
 
Just about the same time I was turning over wallpaper sources in my head, I was approached by a Wallpaper company based in Los Angeles, called **DesignYourWall.com.** I liked that they had in-house designers for a more **customised approach** and together we worked to create a gorgeous print for my floor.
 
3. Peel back the backing of the wallpaper bit by bit and line it up against the edge of your floor. Use the other hand to smooth out the paper with the card as you go. If you find air bubbles appear just lift the contact paper back up and smooth it out again.
 
7. Finally the floor needs to be sealed. Open a can of **clear polyurethane** and stir well. For best results,**use a floor pad**( I used a paint brush)****and apply it to the floor with long, even strokes. Let the floor dry for approximately four hours between coats.
