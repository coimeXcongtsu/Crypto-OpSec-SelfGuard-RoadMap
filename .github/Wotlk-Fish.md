This is a listing of all **Northrend fish** introduced with the Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Inlinegfx/img\_link\_data.json' not found. Wrath of the Lich King expansion.
 
These are the details on how to catch Northrend fish. The skill listed is the minimum amount of fishing skill (lures included) needed to cast in these waters. The "cap" is the amount of fishing skill needed to keep the fish from getting away. For fish that can be caught in multiple zones, the lowest zone is listed for the minimum skill and a range is listed for the cap due to it varying by zone. Almost all fish can be found in open water, but some fish concentrate into Schools of Fish within fishing pools, which are also listed.

Fish are the main ingredients for cooking three of the feasts in WotLK. These can feed multiple members of a party, and Fish Feast are often used before dungeons, raids, or even PvP. The following fish are used in the indicated feasts:
 
Since leveling your fishing takes a long time, it's best to level these professions together. You'll discover that it requires a lot of patience and time to build your skill level up to the maximum level. You will have to catch a lot of fish to get from start to finish.
 
Go to Thunder Bluff and fish in the pond near Thunder Bluff's auction house until your skill reaches 165. You don't have to use any lures. **Don' forget to visit**Kah Mistrunner **between fishing skill 125 and 150, to train Expert Fishing!**

Up to this point, any extra fishing skill from the fishing pole wasn't needed, but I would recommend getting a better Fishing pole for the upcoming parts. You will simply catch less junk in higher-level areas with the extra +25 or +20 Fishing skill.

WIthout basically cheating the best thing to use is the addon Fishing Buddy (Linked above). It will do most of everything you need without catching the fish for you (Which I believe would be cheating).
 
Note that, when you do level Fishing, you will have a huge amount of fishthat can be used to level your Cooking. It is recommended that youuse this fish to level Cooking up at the same time, saving yourself plenty ofgold.
 
Fishing is one of the three secondary professions available to all playersin WotLK Classic. Because of this, it can be learned by all players withoutconflicting with other professions. This can be useful early on to provideyourself with free food while leveling.
 
You can learn Fishing from any Fishing trainer, which are found incapital cities. When you arrive at a major city, you can ask any city guard fordirections and pick the Fishing trainer option under the professions section.This will mark its location on your map, allowing you to easily find them andget the Fishing skill.
 
Fishing is a fairly easy, but time-consuming, profession to level. You shouldtry to level it alongside Cooking, as a large portion of what youfish up can be used to keep your cooking skill at a similar level to yourfishing skill. These two professions go hand-in-hand together.
 
In Wrath of the Lich King, you can level the Fishing skill in anywater where you can cast your line. This allows you to easily sit at the Fishingtrainer in a capital city and level from 1-300 in one spot.
 
At level 300, you will have to head to Outland and talk withJuno Dufrain to learn Master Fishing. You can also learn this from one ofthe Northrend trainers shown above. When you can get your total fishing skill toaround 400, you can head to Northrend and finish leveling there, or stay inOutland until you max out at 375.
 
At level 375, you will have to head to Northrend and talk with one of theGrand Master Fishing trainersshown above. This will allow you tomax out your Fishing skill at 450, the highest possible level in Wrath of theLich King.
 
In addition to your raw Fishing Skill, you can further increase your skill byusing specific items, enchantments, gear, and consumables. This allows you tofish in higher level areas earlier and increases the chance that you will land afish instead of junk.
 
A fishing pole is one of the easiest ways to gain an increase to yourFishing skill. Arcanite Fishing Pole remains the best-in-slot fishing polein the game, but requires you to win the Stranglethorn Vale fishing tournamentto obtain it, making it rare. Mastercraft Kalu'ak Fishing Pole is a closealternative option that can be obtained much more easily asThe Kalu'ak is an easy faction to gain reputation for.
 
Fishing Lures are one the easiest and best ways to temporarily gain a largeincrease to your Fishing skill. Make sure to bring plenty of these with youbefore you head out on a fishing trip or you may run out before you finish.
 
You can still complete the TBC fishing dailies for their specific rewards.Every day you will be able to grab one of five different quests fromOld Man Barlo, who can be found at the lake just north of Shattrath Cityin Terokkar Forest.
 
Fishing is just one of the many professions you may choose to level inWrath of the Lich King Classic. To learn more about the other options available,we recommend checking out our overviews of all professions and their uniquebonuses below.
 
This guide has been written by Abide, TBC and WotLK veteran for nearlya decade. Abide is a Warrior tank and multi-class expert currently playingon Faerlina Horde. You can find him in theIcy Veins Discord if you haveany questions or concerns.
 
Along with Blizzard's 3.1 release for World of Warcraft, there were changes that effect how one fishes in Azeroth and Outland. Where before, there were both a minimum and a no-get-away level for each zone. After the patch, one can fish any where at any level. The catch is, one will catch more junk if he is in an zone that he is too low to fish in. Although, he will still gain fishing level as if he was fishing in a zone that he properly experienced for.
 
So the questions are, if one is fishing in a zone that he meets and exceeds the required minimum fishing level for, whether it be with or without fishing gear and bait, does he have a chance to fish up junk still, let a fish get away, and fish up the better catch at a higher rate for the zone? Along with those three questions, does the bobber have a higher chance to bob earlier in the fishing cast too?
 
**Note**: Please keep in mind that there are **four** questions with in this one Gaming SE question? Since I already know how to fish, please do not post links to fishing tutorials. These are questions that I have always ask myself time after time but was never able to find answers. I can't be the only one who has thought about these same questions. Maybe I am though?
 
What used to be the minimum required skill to fish in any given area is now the minimum required skill to not catch any junk. Once you meet or exceed this minimum for a zone, whether natively, or through the use of equipment, buffs and consumables, you will no longer catch ANY junk. If you are below this skill level, the chance of catching junk is proportional to just how far below it you are. The further below the threshold, the more junk you'll catch.
 
For example, the Dalaran Fountain has a no-junk skill of 525. As we can see in @GreatBigFish's answer, this junk threshold is above the (unbuffed) WOTLK maximum skill of 450. Fishing at max skill in Dalaran with no lure would yield a 'fish' roughly 73% of the time. The other 27% of the time, you will catch one of the 13 'junk' items found around the world, all of which vendor for mere copper. To never catch junk in Dalaran, you'd need to use a +75 lure or better at 450 skill.
 
There is one notable exception to this rule: You will never catch junk in a pool. Fishing from pools gives a 100% catch rate on whatever type of fish spawns in that pool. This has caused many to claim that actively leveling fishing skill is now pointless because it provides little practical benefit - fishing from pools is always more efficient anyway.
 
**World of Warcraft**wasn't the first RPG or MMO to have a fishing minigame, but the concept of a profession that was connected to other activities, like quest
