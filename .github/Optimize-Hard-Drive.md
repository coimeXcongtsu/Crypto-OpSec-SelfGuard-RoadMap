Files are created and erased while using a Windows computer. When a user erases a file, Windows leaves empty storage blocks behind that subsequent write operations will attempt to fill. If a file is larger than those empty blocks can accommodate, part of the file writes to the empty blocks while the remainder goes to empty storage blocks residing elsewhere on the disk. The result is a fragmented file.
 
Disk fragmentation is a problem because hard disks read and write data by moving mechanical heads across the surface of a disk. When a file is fragmented, the disk heads move to various locations to read all of the file's blocks. These physical movements take time to complete, and the more head movements required, the longer it takes to read or write a file.

Defragmentation attempts to rearrange storage blocks linearly. The goal is a read process that does not require any unnecessary head movements. Empty space on the drive is also consolidated, thereby helping to make write operations more efficient.
 
Windows 10 disk optimization is a relatively simple process. Begin by opening File Explorer and right-click on the disk that you want to defragment. Next, select the **Properties** command from the resulting shortcut menu, which opens the disk's properties sheet (Figure 1).
 
Although not technically a requirement, it is a good idea to click on the **Disk Cleanup** button. The Disk Cleanup window gives you the option of removing some of the clutter that may be taking up space on the system's hard disk -- including downloaded program files, temporary internet files and offline webpages.
 
The Optimize Drive window displays the available disks for optimization, distinguished between hard disks, virtual hard disks and solid-state drives, or SSDs (Figure 3). Windows only allows you to optimize drives directly connected to your system, so you won't see any network drives on the list.

Note that defragmentation is a write-intensive process that can cause premature wear on an SSD. Instead of defragmenting an SSD, Windows performs a trim operation when you optimize an SSD, reserving defragmentation solely for HDDs. Trimming an SSD erases data blocks that are no longer in use and can improve an SSD's performance.
 
In addition to the native Windows disk optimization tool, there are also third-party options available. CCleaner, for example, offers both a free and a pro version of its Defraggler tool. And Auslogics offers a free and paid version of its disk defragmenting tool. Raxco offers a disk defragmenting tool called PerfectDisk that has home and business editions as well as versions specifically designed for servers and virtual machines.
 
Converting basic disks to dynamic disks can help achieve improved performance in your Windows OS. However, there are compatibility restrictions you should be aware of before diving into this conversion process.
 
When your computer slows down, you might consider optimizing your computer's hard drive, for it has a direct impact on your PC's performance. If the hard drive is not in good condition, it will cause the computer to be unresponsive, and in severe cases, will cause the computer freezes.
 
However, you need to be aware that due to the different construction of HDD and SSD, their optimization methods are also different. Defraging HDD will improve its performance, but defraging SSD will seriously damage this SSD.
 
If your PC hard drive is HDD, its poor performance may be caused by too many file fragments, because the hard drive will spend a lot of time reading the scattered data. So, you can try to defrag HDD to optimize the hard drive with the Defragment and Optimize Drives.
 
If you purely want to increase the read and write speed of the hard drive, you can enable the Write Caching. Since the computer writes data to the cache faster than to the hard drive, when you enable the Write Caching, the hard drive will be faster. The detailed steps are as follows:
 
The hard drive also performs poorly when the space of it is insufficient. Therefore, you need to free up hard drive space on your PC. In addition to the commonly used Disk Cleanup, you can also try Storage Sense on Windows 10 to optimize hard drive.
 
(Full problem) My computer was being very slow, I initially though windows Update and stuff so I left it, but it continued for days,so I opened task manger and monitored in between my work, even for extended periods of time the disk usage(HDD) is always at >90%, no matter the number of tasks or the disk transfer rate. I read online that defragging would solve the issue, so I ran the windows defragger and it really went down. I also came across suggestions to use defraggler piriform(I always use ccleaner but I never knew this existed).
 
(Please read this) Here I made a big mistake after analysing in piriform defraggler I also ran optimize, I later came across the defraggler doc which goes "optimize is for SSD". My computer uses HDD. What should I do now, it's been stuck at**optimizing(83%)**. And my PC disk usage is at 100% again. I am afraid my HDD will fail. Please tell me what should I do?. Should I cancel the optimize? and just run defrag?.
 
PS. Disk usage will almost always be at 100% access when defragging/optimising. If you want to do something else that needs disk access then it's not a problem as the defragger will stop using 100% until it can again.
 
Edit:
As for the built in Windows 10 Optimize Drives running in the background and interfering with your work on the PC you can get around that by manually running it such as; Start it when you know you won't be using the PC for many hours such as before you go to bed and let it run overnight (remember to turn off your monitor so it isn't needlessly using power and being worn out):
1. Open: This PC
2. Right click your hard disk drive and select: Properties
3. Click: Tools
4. Under Error Checking click: Check
5. Under Optimize and defragment drive click: Optimize, then in the Optimize Drives window highlight your hard disk drive and select Optimize.
6. You can now turn off your monitor and leave the computer to finish optimizing the drive without interruption.
 
One thing is for certain with an SSD the optimization is done so quickly it won't interrupt you when working, you won't even notice it. Getting something like a small SSD OS boot drive of at least 240GB to 256GB is more-or-less a standard (although with current pricing at least 480GB to 512GB makes more sense price-wise) and is all that's really needed for Windows 10 to fit comfortably. The hard disk drive can be repurposed as a mass storage data drive to store music, movies, etc., that you don't want taking up the SSD capacity.
 
ChkDsk shows more information that you can digest, plus it can be more powerful such as running a surface scan using ChkDsk /R to find bad sectors which is something I do no more than once or twice per year on my backup hard disk but that takes hours on a 1TB or larger hard disk.
 
The culprit in my case was the Intel Rapid Storage app. The acceleration mode was on maximized. I switched off acceleration mode completely then reset acceleration mode to enhanced (a couple of restarts are involved in this process).
 
Same issue here with a Samsung EVO 850 recognized as a HDD and shown as removable in the systray, across numerous versions of Windows 10 Home.Machine is an hp Omen 870-267nz which turned out to have only 3 SATA connectors on the motherboard, one of which was used for the DVD drive. I wanted to have a 2nd SSD and keep the HD, so connected the EVO 850 SSD instead of the DVD drive, which works just as well over a USB adapter connected to a free USB 2.0 port.Spent a lot of time trying the suggestions above and others to no avail. SSD didn't show up in BIOS but was detected in Windows as a hard disk - functional but defragmenting instead of trimming. Finally opened the case and swapped the SATA connectors of the SSD and HD this morning. Now SSD shows as SSD, no longer removable. HD still shows as HD, but has become removable. Time to reformat the EVO 850 to make sure alignment is ok and it will be all good :-)Bottom line: apparently the 3rd SATA connector on the motherboard has limitations that don't matter with a DVD drive but make it less compatible with SSDs and HDs.
 
None of the above work for me, every time when I run any of the commands, it only runs the benchmark on my D: drive, which is a HDD. Even when I run winsat disk -drive C to indicate the SSD drive, it still starts benching D:, and in the end C: remains marked as HDD (it's a SanDisk SSD). If I run winsat disk -drive D: it runs the benchmark also on D: It doesn't matter what I tell it, it won't touch the C. Anyone has any ideas?
 
Thankfully, you can speed up a hard disk using HDD optimization apps; a few different tools are available. In this article, we're going to look at which utilities can improve the speed and efficiency of a hard disk.
 
Unless you'd fiddled with the settings, it should already be running on an automatic schedule. To check, head to **Start > Windows Administrative Tools > Defragment and Optimize drives**.
 
Highlight the drive you want to fix, then click either **Analyze** or **Optimize**, depending on the function you want to carry out. To make sure the scheduling is set up correctly, click on**Change settings** and tick the box next to **Run on schedule**.
 
Performing disk defragmentation is less critical on SSDs than HDDs, but Microsoft still recommends running the tool once per month. In fact, you shouldn't defrag your SSD, as it only increases wear and tear, and the SSD has built-in tools for file management.
 
It has a few more features than the native Windows tool. For example, Disk SpeedUp can automatically shut down your computer after the defrag process i
