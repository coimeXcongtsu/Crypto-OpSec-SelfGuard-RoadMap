Until yesterday also it was in good status. Suddenly today when I ran the tool it's showing caution. Reallocated Sector Count is 1.I have attached a screenshot below of the same.

I wanted to know the reason behind this sudden fault. Is running is application regularly safe? I ran this application along with with other applications already running like chrome, did that create some problem? Also, I am skeptical that this problem is originated because of crystal disk info only because everything was fine till then. Do I need to worry? Is there some other way I can verify this?
 
Crystal Disk Info has a solid reputation, so its a good tool to use. All it is doing is reporting on what the disk thinks of itself. (There are plenty of other tools that do the same thing). The change in HDD status is most likely coincidental, and you will not likely be able to pinpoint any particular piece of software that triggered it (and it would not be the fault of that software anyway - these problems exist below the level that most software works at)

HDD's are a bit tricky and SMART (the info on the drive that is being read) is difficult to interpret and not overly reliable - but it is an indicator your HDD is not doing great. FWIF, HDDs are the most likely component to fail in a computer, and are the most important.
 
**CrystalDiskInfo** is an app designed to help you keep your PC's hard drive healthy. The app, which supports S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) technology, helps you detect and prevent future disk surface errors so that you can take timely action before data loss becomes irreplaceable.
 
The first thing you will see when running CrystalDiskInfo is a clear and simple interface that displays all the detailed information about your main hard disk: from the brand and model to the buffer size and cache, as well as the serial number or even the firmware. With a single click, you can take a look at any other hard disk connected to the PC. And again, you can instantly see data such as the temperature or the hours it has been on.
 
The software uses a color scheme to warn you about the dangerousness of the disk status. By default, if all goes well, the most important information on your hard disks will appear in green or blue, depending on the style you are using. This way, if you see that the temperature or some other parameter turns yellow, you know you should be careful and pay attention to any possible problem.
 
CrystalDiskInfo is an excellent tool for monitoring hard disks and SSD drives to know, with a simple glance, the health status of one of the most important parts of your PC. The program is also fully customizable, with different color schemes, dark mode and the possibility to choose from more than twenty different languages.
 
No, CrystalDiskInfo isn't available on Mac. CrystalDiskInfo is only available on Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows 11, as well as various versions of Windows Server.
