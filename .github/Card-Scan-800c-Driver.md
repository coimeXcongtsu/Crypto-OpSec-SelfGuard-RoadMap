This is absolutely frustrating that still there is no fix and the \*\*\*\* scanner 800c is lying dead with me. Why can't this be solved. Earlier had cardscan 600 that is lying dead now 800c frustrating endless.

Well, it's February 2016 and the request to have this fixed (Oct2015), with Apple and Dymo has gone unanswered. Dymo say they are waiting for Apple and Apple are AWOL. Please, can someone look into the driver problem that has resulted in El Capitan (now at 10.11.3 - 25/01/2016) not recognising the USB attached 800c scanner making the CardScan Executive Pro application and hardware 800c scanner desktop junk.
 
My CardScan 800C is now working again with El Capitan after the 10.11.4 maintenance release. There is no mention of a fix in the release notes but it just started working again. Worth a try for anyone else...
 
Which version of CardScan are you using. I originally had version 8 but Dymo told me that I needed version 9 to work with IOS. They have now sent me a link to download version 9.2 but this wil not install on El Capitan?
 
**PLEASE NOTE: CardScan scanners are only compatible with OS X 10.8 through 10.10. On other versions of OS X, CardScan scanners and software may be used in a virtual environment with compatible versions of Windows.**

And they would be correct, but what we have found is that it starts working again with 10.11.4 but also be aware, that there have been a number of smaller upgrades to do with scanner, camera and USB devices. So, I assume if you have upgraded to 10.11.4 and still have the problem, then there might be other less obvious upgrades that you might have decided to pass on, as they don't apply to you. I'm not sure if these offerings from Apple are cumulative i.e. if you miss one another added that to the stack. So, I'd suggest that you look into the upgrade status of your Apple software stack and see if that fixes the problem.
 
I would also, delete the CardScan software and install it again, then follow the registration of the scanner with a blank card and finally, reapply your backed-up database of cards. Get some deeper MAC OS skills to help with making sure that there are no vestiges of the CardScan software on the system before reinstalling would also be a good idea.
 
Thanks for the reply and advice. I don't think that Ive missed any updates but have checked in my App Store history - this tells me that I haven't installed 10.11 (although I have installed 10.11.4). If I select the option to install 10.11 I get a message saying that I am already running 10.11.4 but still have the option to install 10.11.
 
Do you think that I should install 10.11? Alternatively I've read that 10.11.5 is now in beta testing, perhaps I should wait for that before doing anything else, although if the driver type updates to which you refer were in the 10.11 update will they still be missing after updating to 10.11.5?
 
Once you download your new driver, then you need to install it. To install a driver in Windows, you will need to use a built-in utility called Device Manager. It allows you to see all of the devices recognized by your system, and the drivers associated with them.
 
In the Device Manager window, locate the device for which you want to install or update the driver. You can find devices under their respective categories, such as **Display adapters**, **Sound, Video and Game Controllers**, or **Network adapters**.
 
Click on the **Browse** button and navigate to the location where you saved the downloaded driver files. Select the appropriate driver file and click **OK**. Then, click **Next** to begin the installation process.
 
Many device drivers are not updated through the Microsoft Windows Update service. If you are having trouble finding the right driver, stop searching and fix driver problems faster with the Automatic Driver Update Utility. Automatic updates could save you hours of time.
 
The Driver Update Utility automatically finds, downloads and installs the right driver for your hardware and operating system. It will Update all of your drivers in just a few clicks, and even backup your drivers before making any changes.
 
When the scan is complete, the driver update utility will display a results page showing which drivers are missing or out-of-date. You can update individual drivers, or all of the necessary drivers with one click:
 
If you have had recent crashes, power outages, viruses or other computer problems, it is likely that your drivers may have become damaged. Browse the list above to find the driver that matches your device hardware. To see more matches, use our custom driver search engine to find the exact driver.
 
CardScan is a tool designed to easily and quickly integrate DYMO label printing or card scanning into any Windows or custom embedded system. To develop an application, you will need a compiler and linker compatible with libraries and DLLs generated by Microsoft Visual C v5.0 or later and CardScan 9.2 or later.
 
Currently a user has a Dymo Cardscan 800c ( -US/cardscan-executive-empty-card-scanner ). While they released software v9 that supports Office 2016 and Windows 8, it does not appear to work on Windows 10 at all from various things I have tried.
 
This user sometimes has boat loads of cards to do and so something as automated as possible it ideal, even to the point of if it works well, the executives them selves may get one to do their own cards.
 
When we used it, it worked pretty well. Another option would be to use any scanner and use the PaperPort software that allows you to scan 8-10 cards off of a flatbed scanner and will separate the images, or at least it used to, I have not used PaperPort for that in a while.
 
Newer ID card scanners are built around a CIS photographic scan head, instead of a CCD or CMOS scan head as well, which allows for higher resolution and better image quality with all the annoying security measures on the cards. Depending on how the cards are designed, they often have to be fed through sideways through CIS scanners because of how some states orient the holograms on the cards.
 
I would look at a ScanShell or Snapshell scanner to replace your hardware. Both have twain compliant models, and some take images as a digital photograph instead of a moving scan. SnapShells are commonly used in government offices for scanning passports.
 
New York went to the black and white portrait on polycarbonate in 2013. They dont flex very well at all. I havent heard of any changes since then. The licenses are primarily laser engraved and perforated, so there shouldnt be any visual security measure affecting your scanners. This sounds like the driver is having issues with the image processing.
 
ScanShell 800 NR is the perfect hardware ID Card Scanner for capturing ID cards such as driver licenses, corporate or medical ID card. The mobile A6 ScanShell 800 NRis a sheet-fed twain compatible color ID card scanner, which interfaces to any standard USB port with auto-detect sensor for instant scanning.

 
With its lightweight ideal compact design, scanning quality and easy USB connection its a perfect companion for your computer facility. Using your twain compliant software, you can easily save and keep the information of ID cards quickly and clearly for on-the-spot identification.

\*This scanner does not work with our idScan applications and does not have OCR capabilities. It scans only the image of the card. For a complete ID card scanner solution check our idScan for Driver Licenses application.
