The system scans entire vehicles bumper to bumper in seconds as they drive through without stopping. Detailed images reveal even small items such as handguns, and color coding highlights explosives, drugs and other organic materials. The system's low X-ray dose allows drivers and passengers to remain in the vehicle while it is scanned, enabling the system to scan 150 vehicles per hour or more in the normal flow of checkpoint traffic.

According to a March 2021 report, ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) are the fastest developing segments in automotive electronics. By 2025 (just a couple short years away), experts predict that 85 percent of cars on the road worldwide will have ADAS. Looking specifically at the United States, more than half of new cars will at least have L1 technology (driver assistance such as automatic emergency braking, collision, avoidance, adaptive cruise control, and so forth). More than a third (35 percent) will have L2 technology, partial automation such as fully automatic parking assist and automatic emergency steering and braking. Another 9 percent will have L3 conditional automation, and one in every hundred cars will be highly to fully automated.
 
Inspection stations in Vermont are privately owned and operated by our business partners. Inspection stations and certified Inspection Mechanics are licensed by DMV to conduct inspections as prescribed in the Vermont Periodic Inspection Manual.
 
A scan tool with generic OBD II capability is necessary to perform the required check. A scan tool is a very useful device which is commonly used to assist in the diagnosis and repair of a variety of vehicle problems. Many inspection stations already own scan tools which can also be used to perform the required OBD check, but those inspection stations which do not will need to have one in order to inspect 1996 and newer vehicles. At a minimum, scan tools must be capable of :
 
New York State (NYVIP3) inspections include a check of on-board diagnostic system (OBDII) on non-exempt vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) less than 8,501 pounds and that are gas-powered or diesel-powered vehicles with a model year less than or equal to the current year minus two and greater than the current year minus 25.
 
Licensed inspection stations use (NYVIP3) equipment to monitor the on-board diagnostic system (OBDII) of your vehicle. 1 If the OBDII detects a problem that can result in excessive emissions, a malfunction indicator light (MIL) illuminates to inform the driver or automotive technician.
 
A non-exempt gas-powered vehicle that is not subject to the OBDII emissions inspection is subject to the low-enhanced emissions inspection. Diesel-powered vehicles are exempt from the low-enhanced emissions inspection.


 
The inspection equipment prints the test results and a receipt. If your vehicle fails the test, the test result will indicate the reason for the failure. It will also provide helpful information to an automotive technician who repairs the vehicle.


 
If your vehicle is required to receive an OBDII emissions test, and it does not qualify for a waiver (see below), the vehicle must pass that inspection in order to receive an inspection sticker. The failure of the vehicle to pass the inspection can prevent the renewal of the vehicle registration. You must have the vehicle repaired to meet the standards and pass a re-inspection.
 
After the re-inspection, if the vehicle qualifies, the inspector can print a waiver form. Both you and the inspector must sign the waiver. The inspection station keeps the waiver and other related documents. The inspector then issues the inspection sticker for your vehicle valid for 1 year.
 
The warning light is the malfunction indicator light (MIL) of the OBDII system. The color of the MIL is red or yellow. The MIL can display the words, "check engine soon", "service engine soon", or words that are similar. The MIL on some vehicles displays the image of an engine with the word, "check".
 
The MIL normally illuminates when you insert the key and turn the vehicle ignition toward the position that starts the vehicle engine. If there is no problem, the MIL does not remain illuminated while the engine operates. If you start your engine and the MIL remains illuminated, your OBDII system has a problem.
 
The problem may reduce fuel efficiency, increase air pollution, or cause harm to your vehicle. Take your vehicle to a qualified automotive technician to determine the severity of the problem and what service or repairs are required. Normally the illumination of the MIL is not an indication of a malfunction that requires immediate attention, but an unresolved malfunction may lead to more serious problems or costly repairs.
 
To indicate a possible serious malfunction, the MIL flashes on and flashes off while the engine operates. Take your vehicle to an automotive technician immediately, and only operate your vehicle if necessary. Do not operate your vehicle at fast speeds, and do not use your vehicle to carry or tow a heavy load.
 
A: If a vehicle fails either portion of the emissions test, the owner must have the emissions-related repairs performed before being retested. There is no charge to the motorist for retesting failed vehicles. Satisfactory completion of the test requirements is necessary before vehicle registration renewal. The lane technician provides all motorists with an informational brochure at the initial failed test to explain the repair and retest process.
 
A: Under certain conditions vehicle owners may apply to the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for an exhaust emissions waiver. The Division does not grant waivers for failed fuel system tests or **safety examinations**. Waivers are issued to vehicles that continue to fail the exhaust emissions test even after appropriate repairs have been made. To be eligible, all items on the following check list must apply:
 
A: The federal Clean Air Act spells out air quality standards that all areas of the United States must meet. Motor vehicles are one of the major causes of air pollutants. Vehicle emissions include carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC). Vehicle testing assures that vehicle-generated emissions are within specified standards.
 
A: Typically, vehicles are tested biennially based upon the model year "and vehicles being titled/registered for the first time in Delaware". The testing is required prior to registration renewal. Vehicles in the first 7 model years are excluded from testing. The Division electronically sends registration renewal notices approximately 90 days before registrations expire. **Set up electronic renewal notification**.

A: When a motorist enters the test facility, the lane associate will ask for the vehicle to be placed in a park position. Once the vehicle is safely parked, the lane associate will ask for the vehicle registration card and the odometer reading to enter the essential information into a computer system. Below is a chart breaking down the emission standards for the State of Delaware per The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Control (DNREC).
