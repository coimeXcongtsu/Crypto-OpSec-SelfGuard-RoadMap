This functionality may seem legitimate and useful, however, Search Defender Prime is categorized as a potentially unwanted application (PUA) and a browser hijacker, since it often infiltrates systems without users' consent. In addition, Search Defender Prime promotes a fake search engine and records information relating to browsing activity.
 
Developers use Search Defender Prime to promote the searchdefenderprime.com search engine, which is fake. To achieve this, Search Defender Prime hijacks the most popular browsers and assigns the new tab URL, default search engine, and homepage options to searchdefenderprime.com.
 
These changes may seem insignificant, however, users are unable to revert them - Search Defender Prime reassigns options when attempts are made to change them. Therefore, returning browsers to their previous states is impossible, unless Search Defender Prime is uninstalled.
 
Thus, users are forced to visit searchdefenderprime.com when they open a new browser tab or search via the URL bar. This significantly diminishes the browsing experience. Note that searchdefenderprime.com redirects to search.yahoo.com when a search query is entered.
 
Therefore, users simply end up searching via Yahoo (a legitimate search engine) and searchdefenderprime.com becomes redundant. Search Defender Prime and searchdefenderprime.com continually record information relating to browsing activity.
 
Browser hijackers and fake search engines typically gather information such as IP addresses, website URLs visited, pages viewed, and geolocations. Furthermore, recorded data usually includes personal details that developers share with third parties (potentially, cyber criminals).

These people generate revenue by misusing private information. Therefore, data tracking can lead to serious privacy issues or even identity theft. We strongly recommend that you eliminate the Search Defender Prime browser hijacker and avoid searchdefenderprime.com.
 
There are hundreds of browser-hijacking applications that share similarities with Search Defender Prime including My Forms Suite, Easy Weather Forecast, and Go Maps - these just some examples from many. Note that most of these applications offer useful features, however, these false promises are merely attempts to give the impression of legitimacy and trick users to install.
 
In fact, browser hijackers are designed only to generate revenue for the developers. Rather than giving any real value for regular users, apps such as Search Defender Prime cause unwanted redirects and gather sensitive data.
 
Search Defender Prime is free for anyone to download on its official website, however, it often infiltrates computers without consent, since developers proliferate it using intrusive advertisements (usually delivered by other potentially unwanted applications, such as File Convert Pro browser hijacker) and a deceptive marketing method called "bundling".
 
Intrusive advertisements redirect users to dubious websites or run scripts designed to download/install PUAs. "Bundling" is stealth installation of third party applications together with regular software. Developers hide "bundled" apps behind "Custom/Advanced" settings (or other sections) of the download/installation processes.
 
The main reasons for computer infections are poor knowledge of these threats and careless behavior. Caution is the key to safety. Therefore, pay close attention when browsing the Internet and downloading/installing software.
 
Intrusive advertisements typically seem legitimate, since developers invest many resources into their design, however, they usually redirect to dubious websites (gambling, adult dating, pornography, and similar). If you encounter these ads or redirects, remove all suspicious applications and browser plug-ins immediately.
 
Carefully analyze each window of the download/installation dialogs using the "Custom" or "Advanced" settings. Opt-out of additionally-included applications and decline offers to download/install them. Avoid using third party downloaders, since most are monetized using the "bundling" method (developers promote PUAs).
