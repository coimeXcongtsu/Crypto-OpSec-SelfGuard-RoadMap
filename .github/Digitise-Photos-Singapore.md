Take time to digitise old, printed photos too. We love the Google Scan app; it captures photos and instantly stores them in your Google Photos or even Apple Photos library. We also recommend creating printed photo albums. These make your memories easily accessible to family and friends, and act as an additional backup.
 
We also encourage families to set up a joint photo library as a digital photo hub. This would be on a separate and unique account. Each family member can then regularly import the photos they wish to share, and all family members have access to the joint photo library.

If your books are fragile, then a gentle touch is used to ensure that they are not damaged during the scanning process.
 
A high-resolution scanner is used to scan each page of your books. The scanner is equipped with the latest scanning technology, which ensures that your books are scanned quickly and accurately. Large format scanning is also available for books that are larger than the standard size.
 
After your books have been scanned, they are checked for quality control. This ensures that all pages have been scanned and that the digital files are of the highest quality. The digital files are then outputted in a format that is suitable for your needs. This can include searchable PDFs or high-resolution images.
