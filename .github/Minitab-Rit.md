Since MiniTab can now take external data and generate graphs and charts from it, I thought it may be beneficial to pass this along to others that may want this functionality in one of their apps. The BD is wide and not optimized for speed but the code does work. By all means go ahead and make this your own and speed it up where you think you can. I am still working on what Commands need to be fed into the Project Node.
 
By no means am I an expert as Labview coding or the MiniTab API. I'll help where I can but I may not get to in a timely manner. My company was working on a project using Excel data to MiniTab and returning reports back and thought I would try Labview and it works.

As to the MiniTab report part...how I did it was I loaded the data I was going to use directly into MiniTab and just started played with what graph or chart I wanted until I got the desired output that I was looking for. Then I went into Show Histroy (CTRL+ALT+H) and looked at the code used to generate that Minitab chart/graph. Copy and Paste that into the ExecuteCommand "Command" Invoke Node (it expects a string) and you have a photo of your chart to do whatever you want to do with it. Remember, this is version 17 so newer versions could be different.
 
I too need to create graphs for the calculation of Cp and Cpk and I would like to automate the procedure. What have to be installed on the pc regarding Labview and Minitab?......Are there any particular libraries?
 
I would like to use the features of minitab to create the graphs....not only Cp and Cpk but also histograms, time series graphs, etc.  
I saw the example you shared, how did you create the reference to minitab?  
I have installed Labview 2017 and minitab18
 
How I did it was I placed a Application Refrum right on the Front Panel, then right-clicked, choose the Select ActiveX Class, then searched for, I think, it's MTB Type 17.0. Yours might be MTB Type 18.0. Then wire it up using the Automation Open ActiveX icon.

I have a data set which I want to display as a dot plot in a similar way to minitab - there is just 1 axis (% saved) and each row in my data set represents a different case with a different % saving rounded to nearest full %. I want to show this in Qlikview but nearest I have gotten is via a Bar Chart which shows the right shape, but unable to get this to represent the bar as dots i.e. for each instance the value occurs (don't worry about the fact that minitab representing 3 occurances per dot - I just need 1 dot per occurance).
 
Siena Heights University students, faculty, and staff can utilize Minitab, software used for data analysis and statistics, on or off-campus starting this year. With our annual renewal of the software, Minitab now offers a web version and a downloadable Windows desktop version of their software free to all members of the SHU community. To access your Minitab account, visit this link or look for an email from Minitab sent earlier this year.
 
Minitab now supports accessing the statistical program through a new web app made available to SHU. The web application has many of the same features you may be familiar with and now includes direct OneDrive support, allowing for quick saving and loading from your Siena Heights University cloud storage. If you utilize a MacOS device or Linux-based machine, you will need to use the web application. Minitab discontinued support for all non-Windows platforms in early 2021.
 
To access the web app, visit app.minitab.com and enter your full SHU email address. You will not be able to use social media logins on this page. Once you enter your email address and click Next, you will need to sign in through Office.com if you are not logged in already. After signing in successfully, access to the web application and account settings will be given.
 
Minitab currently maintains a Windows desktop application of Minitab. Starting in 2021, the MacOS version was deprecated, leaving only the Windows app and web-based app available to use. This application is free to download for all SHU students, staff, and faculty, and can be found after signing in to the Minitab website with your SHU credentials. Minitab only supports 64-bit versions of Windows, and suggests 32-bit platforms utilize the web application instead.
 
Minitab provides a comparison chart between the web application and the Windows desktop application. Once all features of the Desktop application are integrated to the web version, Minitab will discontinue any downloadable form of their software, opting instead to be fully web-based.
