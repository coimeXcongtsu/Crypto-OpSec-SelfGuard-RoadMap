OMG, what a gem!! Most eclectic creative pizza/food/cocktail menu I've encountered so far in Fort Myers/Cape Coral. I don't know what it is about some of these places in the Cape, they are passionate about their booze. Passionate about their food, reminds me of the science mixologist food/chefs of Portland. The place is gothic, funky, clean-grungy vibe, loved it. Will definitely come back. Only had the Hummus ( very tasty) and a drink, a cucumber lime rosemary gin concoction that was bomb! Can't wait to try their dynamic, creative and explosive menu, which also offer GF crust and healthier options. Xoxo
 
We have heard great things about this place and it has been on our list for a while. Here we go finally. We ordered a couple cocktails to start with. I love my butter beer. It was topped with homemade whipped cream which gave a good contrast with the nitro beer on the bottom. We are not Vegan but my fiance was curious so he ordered the vegan cheese sticks. And it is very good that you can't tell the difference. We had a half and half pizza: black truffle oil and black garlic. Their combination of toppings are nontraditional and unique. We will definitely come back.

Who would have thought I'd give a pizza place in Florida 5 stars. Went where with the bride to be and our mens before the wedding. We got a Big Mick Pizza and a General Tsos pizza with the garlic knots. The food was fantastic. The owner came and ensured everything was going well and was very friendly. I would eat those pizzas every day for the rest of my life if I could.
 
This pizza spot was such a tasty place to visit while visiting friends. As soon as you walk in, you feel like a young kid again with all the cool interior decor it has and the low shining lights. As far as the pizzas, they had different flavors to choose from, some that I have never seen before on pizza. We had the elote pizza, which was really good and had a big taste of corn. We also had the buffalo chicken pizza, I believe, and that was also delicious. Whenever we're in town visiting our friends, we always make it a point to visit nice guys!
 
Mom, prone to drowning others with her emotions, waited for me each day after school. Her impassive look did not reveal whether she would hug me or beat me as I passed. I entered the house dry-mouthed and with heart pounding.
 
So I learned how to hide my feelings behind a deceptive smile, avoid attention and rarely confront. I had a PhD in passivity before I left elementary school. My unassertive nature was fortified by what I learned at church.
 
The Christian nice guy problem also has a misunderstood spiritual component. These men have an incomplete picture of God. Thus, they are encouraged to be nice to a fault, making them emotionally dishonest.

Christian nice guys are encouraged to study the gentle Scriptures but avoid the tougher ones that demand greater discernment and, with it, conflict. The best example comes from Jesus Himself, who said, "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). You may have never heard a sermon on how to be shrewd as a serpent, but you have heard a plethora on how to be innocent as a dove.
 
People have said this forever. I've never given it much thought as to why people say this. Why do they finish last? It seems so unfair when you take it at face value. They're being nice. Why should they always lose?
 
But after writing about that experience, I wondered if it was ALL Nice Guys or just that one. Was it that I didn't feel ready or deserving specifically of him? Or, generally? Was he a nice guy or a guy who happened to be nice? There is a difference.
 
I began to recount whether there had been other nice guys finish last scenarios in my dating history. Turns out there were several. Some who came before Nice Guy (who appeared in that first post) and some who came after.
 
If they are saying yes to everything you say; apologizing for any mistake they perceive they've made even if it's the most absurd thing to apologize for; choose every response carefully out of fear they'll say the wrong thing; say 'yes' to you about everything to avoid argument; please you, your parents, your friends, and their parents and friends to the nth degree; and copy the romantic notions they've seen in rom-coms since the 7th grade than they are scared out of their minds to just be real.
 
They are unsure of what it means to stand up to you or fight with you. They lack confidence in what their own thoughts and feelings and needs may be that may differ or conflict with yours, their family, or their friends. They've allowed themselves to be a doormat and have convinced themselves that it is because they are caring and thoughtful.
 
Being caring and thoughtful is great, but not at the expense of being yourself. And not because you feel it's an expectation or that it automatically means you shall be greatly rewarded. It shouldn't be at the expense of not growing. Of not fighting or disagreeing and really figuring shit out with your partner. Most certainly, not at the expense of eventually becoming resentful of your partner because you've "given them everything" and not received anything in return.
 
Once the relationship has headed south, nice guys become ridiculously hard to break up with without crushing their very souls. They've told you on more than one occasion that "You're my everything." "I don't know what I would do without you."
 
They figuratively throw everything at you because you've had to tell them you're not the right fit. Out of the woodwork comes all of the shit they've been internalizing. That resentment comes flying out of the wall like razors. You know, all the times that they didn't say what they really thought; didn't pick that fight; didn't say "no" to that thing. Here it comes. That and the kitchen sink. Hurled at your head. And you're like, I am awful. I clearly wasn't deserving of this guy to begin with. What's wrong with me?
 
I've spent most of my life a people pleaser. I'm not one who wants to be confrontational or to disagree, especially with those closest to me. I, too, have wanted to be thoughtful and caring to the point where I have shelved my own wants and needs to put their's first. In doing so, I have helped create the perfect storms that have landed on each of the houses built with these nice guys.
 
If I'm a "nice girl" and they're a "nice guy" then we don't have anything that is actually real. We haven't been confident enough to be ourselves. We haven't been honest enough with each other because we haven't been honest enough with ourselves. Inevitably, each of these relationships with these nice guys has gotten here. To the place where the curtain is pulled back, the tricks explained, and the magic is gone.
 
I own up to my mistakes and faults, I admit when I'm beaten and have made a mistake, and I apologize for the part I've played in getting to the end result: breakup. The nice guys I've been with have not known how to do this. They've deflected and gotten defensive. I've become the villain in each of these stories. The woman who had it all and threw it all away. Ungrateful. Uncaring. Dishonest. Selfish. And my other personal favorite, a woman who will never be loved again the way that they loved me.
 
Perhaps I'm a little bit of all of those things, and I'll take what is rightfully mine to bare. But rarely have I seen them take ownership for their part. Rarely have I seen self-awareness or accountability for how we got to that final place. Our memories and happy times piled around our feet. They can't understand how doing and saying all the "perfect things," never pushing back, never arguing, never disagreeing, could possibly lead to such destruction. And to me, it couldn't be more clear.
 
If they're too dependent on you and have no worth or identity of their own than you've signed up for a babysitting gig. At some point, you want to give the kids back and let their parents deal with them. If they're trying too hard, eventually what was seen as cute or romantic in the beginning now comes across as fake, ingenuine, and unoriginal. If you can predict their every move, you fall into a repeated pattern. For me who wants to change and grow and develop and find excitement in the day-to-day, this gets boring, disinteresting, and evokes repetitious face-palming.
 
They need to know their worth and who they are. To go into a relationship with another person confident enough to push back; say no; argue; disagree; fight; set boundaries; and have other interests besides their relationship and their partner. They certainly need to be able to see other things outside of their coupledom that brings them worth, joy, esteem, and satisfaction. It's too much pressure to make the relationship the center of all things. For when things then get rocky, the whole universe comes crashing down and they are badly burned.
 
I've never meant to start a relationship and have it end with such chaos or drama or tragedy. Such heartbreak. But I've never ended a relationship either without truly feeling that it was serving both myself and the other person more to call it quits than to drag ourselves, hardened, twisted, and bleeding to some metaphorical finish line. Life is way too short. And if it has required being called or seen as the villain, so be it. I'm strong enough to carry that.
 
If nice guys don't want to finish last, they have work they need to do. work they need to do. They have to do it for themselves and by themselves. I'll work on my shit, too. Heaven knows I've got my own unhealthy and ill-placed tendencies. Who doesn't? I know I contributed to the fall of several nice guy empires. That I wasn't always perfect. That I've been hurtful. I do promise it was never intentional.
