You can buy a flannel shirt, seeds, hoop cheese, a Radio Flyer wagon, a squirrel trap, honey, shot gun shells, fertilizer and all that farm stuff and pecans, of course. They sell the gadget to pick up the pecans. It is a nostalgic old store just like small town stores used to be.

I remember many types of gadgets my folks used to crack our pecans. D.J. made me an electric cracking machine that walloped one pecan at a time. It was very interesting but loud and rather messy. Then we had one machine that used a giant rubber band. These ingenious pecan cracking machines are fascinating. One even is called a Kinetic Kracker.
 
And after you gather up your pecans and shells, one needs to lay out the pecans on newspaper to dry a bit. Then you pick through them, removing all the shells. We recycle these shells by spreading them in the yard; the birds love it. Big Mill is eco-friendly. Trip Advisor gave us its prestigious Green Leaders award.

This portable machine is constructed of industrial grade materials, and mild steel that has been primed and painted with oil based paint to aid in the withstanding of many outdoor elements. The 120-volt gear motor turns a rotor inside of a cage and can be easily adjusted with a hand jack for multiple size pecans. Once the cracker is set for the overall average pecan in the batch, it has the potential to crack 200 lbs. or more an hour. The shell out of halves is based upon the pecan freshness, moisture content and the speed at which the machine is fed. The 100 lb. capacity Auto Feeder feeds the machine consistently. A safety overload switch cuts machine off automatically in case of an overload situation. The machine has GFCI shock protection. Both pieces of equipment can fit into a truck bed and can be used for mobile cracking. Minimal maintenance is required, in that once a year the bearings may need to be greased.
 
The Kinetic Kracker is simple and easy enough to use that most members of the family could help out with the cracking and shelling with a little supervision. Just check out the video of our Kinetic Kracker electric nut cracker to see that young man easily cracking all those pecans!
 
The unique design of our Electric Pecan Cracker allows it to apply the precise amount of pressure neededfor your pecans without crushing them. Nearly every time, your pecan will easily slide from the shell with a gentle tug to free the nut meat. Simple and easy.
 
The Kinetic Kracker electric pecan cracker has been flying off of our shelves! We manufacture our electric crackers to the highest standards. Word of mouth is really getting around as people who love using their Kinetic Kracker to shell all those nuts tell their loved ones and even buying them as gifts so others can enjoy their very own freshly shelled pecans from the trees in their own yards.
 
We took our faithful Kinetic Kracker electric nut cracker design, looked it over, and gave it some upgrades. Back and better than ever with more nut cracking power, our Kinetic Kracker delivers the ability to crack 1,560 pecans per hour with 26 RPM motor versus the previous 1,200 nuts with 20 RPM motor that the original design offered. I know that sounds like it could get hot quickly, but each one comes with a fan cooled motor, so don't fret!
 
Do your hands get tired from manually cracking and shelling pecans or does lack of strength due to arthritis prevent you from cracking and enjoying the nut meat from your prized pecan tree? Are your pecan trees full of nuts that you just want to store away? Sometimes, especially during the Holidays, the demand for all those candies that require shelled pecans makes it hard to keep up, but not any longer!
 
Robito Oliva is a small appliance created for dividing or cracking any type of olives. Its easy handling will allow you to create different flavours, using different levels of salt, spices and condiments that you like in a healthy way.
 
It is made up of three pieces that are easily assembled, allowing for quick and safe cleaning. The motor box has two small openings that are easily integrated with the screws in the mechanism housing (attached to the packaging). 3 different positions for the size of the olive.
 
Currently, olives derived for consumption usually contain high levels of preservatives for their maintenance and packaging. Thanks to our appliance we can make, during the olive campaign, delicious combinations with aromatic plants and condiments for the production of delicious olives.
 
Thanks to its simplicity in assembly and its small size, we can use Robito Oliva in any space or place. We can work with different sizes of olives, which allows us to prepare our recipes and use this machine with different varieties and states of maturity of the fruit.

The machine is basically split in two. The hydraulic press or cracking/splitting platform is separate from the copper extraction platform. Each unit has its own motor and can be independent of the other. See the pictures below. The dimensions of each platform are 47 inches by 27 inches by 86 inches, 1,800 pounds for the cracking/splitting platform and 70 inches by 41 inches by 82 inches 2,700 pounds for the copper extraction platform.
 
Only 6 months old. Comes with a 6 month parts only warranty (does not include wear parts such as blades). Customer is redirecting his business and wants to sell this machine purchased in December 2022.
 
**Are you looking to purchase a new or used electric motor wrecker?** We are proud to sell electric motor recycling equipment and can walk you through the benefits. This powerful technology is designed with an ergonomic working height and offers maximum security while in use. For your convenience, it is also easy to relocate!
 
The electric motor recycling machine is capable of disassembling even the toughest motors and separating any and all valuable components. We also offer compressor cutting equipment, such as the CW-809A!
 
In preparation for the mechanical recycling of the electric motor, outer pieces and attachments that can be removed should be unscrewed and put aside. This should reveal the actual external housing of the electric motor.
 
The operator initiates the separation and removal of the outer casing to expose the elements of the electric motor. With extreme high pressure exerted by the splitting apparatus, the aluminum or cast iron housing is cut on opposing sides to separate and peeled away to expose the stator. The anchor/rotor is then removed.
 
The second stage is the cleaving of the stator or transformer block into two equal pieces. By opening these up, copper coils are now exposed and ready for separation from the remaining parts and materials.
 
The third stage of the process involves pulling the copper wiring away from the surrounding metal through which it had been threaded by means of a complex hydraulic system. Teeth grip the winding and pushing rods push the housing away, leaving the copper wiring fully exposed and unattached.
 
Your company can process electric motors in-house and maximize copper and aluminum scrap returns with our electric motor recycling system. Scrap metal prices fluctuate constantly, and our equipment allows you to extract the maximum profit and stay profitable even as prices dip a bit.
 
Efficient and effective recycling processes will become even more critical soon, as sales of electric vehicles begin to grow exponentially and older equipment is retired from service. Stay ahead of the increasing demand for cost-effective recycling of electric vehicle components by investing in an electric motor recycling machine.
 
If you are able to accumulate a significant number of electric motors and accessories for recycling, then the electric motor recycler is a perfect solution for your needs. With a modest investment, this durable system will pay back the investment and earn continually over a long period of time. An average-sized electric motor will require just minutes to disassemble and segregate the valuable components. A qualified worker with experience with our machine can process up to 20 motors per hour.
 
Electric motors have aluminum and copper components inside that have a high value. When they are no longer functional, recycling them allows those components to be salvaged. However, this requires specialized machinery because the steel shells that protect the wiring inside are pretty hard to break. Electric motor recycling machines break those shells to separate the copper and aluminum components.
 
Thanks to its simplicity in assembly and its small size, we can use Robitoliva in any space or place. We can work with different sizes of olives, which allows us to prepare our recipes and use this machine with different varieties and states of maturity of the fruit.
 
To extract the valuable hazelnut cores, the hard shell is cracked. Cracking machines or combined calibration and cracking machines are used. The machines can be adjusted to the size of the nuts. In this way an optimal result is achieved.
