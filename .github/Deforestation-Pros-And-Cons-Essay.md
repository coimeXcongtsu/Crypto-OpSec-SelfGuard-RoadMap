Clear-cuts are forest-felling when all or most of the trees are removed in the selected area at the same time. The method is the most commercially attractive and thus the most typical one. Commonly, trees are cut uniformly. However, there are other options as well.
 
Clear-cuts are done for several purposes, which include **timber harvesting** or **forest regeneration** as part of a reforestation plan. Removal of old trees is beneficial for forest health because they are less immune to pathogens and diseases. Besides, clear-cuts allow **more sunlight for younger trees** that do not tolerate shade. As a result, saplings grow in even-aged stands.

The practice has its pros and cons, depending on when it is used. It is not the only option for merchantable timber logging, yet advantages of clear-cutting make it the most typical way. Nonetheless, negative effects of clear-cutting should not be underestimated, too.
 
Clear-cutting may cause water levels in neighboring currents during the first five to ten years until the saplings start to participate in the water cycle. However, the forest soil has better soil absorption qualities even after deforestation, compared to fields.
 
Clear-cutting is often mistaken for deforestation. Yet, clear-cutting and deforestation are two different terms. Clear-cutting can be regarded as deforestation only when forests are logged for agricultural use, with possible desertification as the most serious land degradation outcome. However, clear-cuts are done with further forest regeneration in most cases, so it is not deforestation. Clear-cutting **stimulates offspring formation** and is beneficial for forest health, as stronger saplings eventually replace weaker ones.
 
Deforestation rates differ globally. For example, the forest lands in North Carolina are mostly private. The forest areas remain rather stable there and occupy nearly 60% Clearcutting...Facts and Myths. www.ncforestservice.gov of the state, as estimated in 2002-2016. Nonetheless, deforestation is still a severe method of land expansion for commercial purposes in many countries.
 
Forest regeneration takes around **thirty years on average**. New saplings typically appear after five years after clear-cuts and grow about ten feet tall by the age of fifteen. Their height reaches twenty to thirty feet at the age of thirty. After clear-cutting, the number of trees increases: nearly a hundred mature trees are replaced with 300-500 off-springs. With time, their density is reduced due to species competition.

However, for the full recovery (particularly of rainforests), much more time is needed. Tropical rainforests may regenerate up to sixty-five years, and animals play a key role in spreading the seeds over the area (nearly 80%) Liebsch, Dieter, Marcia CM Marques, and Renato Goldenberg.

Among different methods of forest management for commercial harvesting, clear-cuts can be precisely detected with remote sensing. It enables foresters to monitor clear-cutting areas and compare their planned and actual size after the procedure. EOSDA Forest Monitoring software helps detect illegal logging, fire hazard zones, and the general forest state. In particular, the NDVI index allows understanding how healthy the forest is and how well selected AOIs re-grow after clear-cutting.
 
Below, there is a tropic forest AOI in Brazil that has been experiencing logging from the end of May 2021 to the end of July 2021. The chart clearly shows the decrease in forest cover area, while the map marks the area territorially.
 
Due to adverse clear-cutting effects, the method is not always the best option and is not a part of sustainable forest management. Still, it is one of the most often used and effective forest management and regeneration techniques when negative effects of clear-cutting are mitigated.

Reforestation is the act of restoring trees in an area where their population has been reduced due to either natural causes or human intervention. Reforestation after a wildfire by intentionally planting new trees or encouraging the natural recovery of degraded forests are just some examples of reforestation.
 
The best reforestation practices recommend immediate planting once a forest is cut down or destroyed. Thus, tree-felling companies are to restore the balance by planting new trees after logging, according to governmental regulations in many countries.
 
The UN New York Declaration of 2014 obliged countries to reduce deforestation twice by 2020 and halt it by 2030 What is the New York Declaration on Forests? Forest Declaration Platform.. However, its annual rate almost doubled instead.
 
It takes around 10 years for soil richness to return after deforestation and 25 years for the whole structure and function of forests to be restored. However, it usually takes 120 years for biodiversity to fully recover. Benefits Of Reforestation Ecosystems can better withstand future stresses from things like climate change and wildfires when they have been reforested. The most significant benefits that can be gained via reforestation are as follows.
 
Photosynthesis explains another advantage of reforestation since plants not only absorb carbon but also release oxygen, maintaining the balance. For this reason, forests are known as the lungs of our planet. Correspondingly, the more forests we have, the purer the air we breathe. Also, reforestation is efficient in preventing dust storms, adding to air purity.
 
Woods fascinate with their ecosystem variety, and one of the richest communities is found in tropical forests. In particular, Amazon rainforests count thousands of tree species and 50,000 other plants, apart from abundant fauna.
 
The World Resources Institute ranked tropical primary forest losses in 2019 as the third-largest in the 21st century Weisse, M., Goldman, E. (2020, June 2). We Lost a Football Pitch of Primary Rainforest Every 6 Seconds in 2019. World Resources Institute.. In this regard, rainforest restoration is an ultimately significant task nowadays. It combats rare species extinction, both in the kingdom of plants and the kingdom of animals.
 
Trees store rainwater by absorbing it with their leaves and roots. At the same time, they also release moisture into the atmosphere via transpiration and increase humidity. This way, forests stabilize the air temperature in the nearby locality. They also help to maintain sufficient water levels in local water bodies. Since trees retain moisture and reduce runoff, reforestation also improves water quality and infiltration.
 
Trees not only absorb moisture but also make a barrier for water flow during floods or downpours. Thus, they slow down the speed of currents and improve water absorption. By impeding floods, reforestation mitigates damage and losses.
 
Planting takes place in two ways: either naturally or artificially. The natural reforestation process relies on the rooting of seeds and sprouts from nearby trees without human assistance. Yet, natural reforestation is insufficient and should be supported by other techniques when tree replacement involves the participation of people.
 
Reforestation is a routine operation for designated forest farms. Their optimal approach combines reforestation and deforestation when forests are cut in a way that helps establish new ones. The idea is to turn the end into the beginning whenever possible.
 
Both of them are used throughout the USA. The choice depends on whether the species can grow in shelter or not and the climatic peculiarities of the region. This is how deforestation gives rise to new tree stands when the remaining mature trees promote new generations. They provide seeds, wildlife habitat, shelter from excessive sunlight or wind, etc.
 
The area size in **group cuts** differs by width and can reach two heights of mature trees. The width depends on the amount of light the species requires. Spruce, fir, maple, hemlock, and red cedar can tolerate shade and will do with a smaller opening. Oaks, loblolly pine, and Douglas fir need more light and, correspondingly, more space. The group selection covers the whole forest tract.
 
The **single-tree** reforestation technique chooses separate trees of all sizes and cuts them evenly through the patch. Since the opening is too narrow, the method is suitable only for shade-tolerant species (e.g., hemlock, sugar maple). It also applies to frosty or dry areas.
 
**Clear-cutting** is the complete removal of mature overstory trees to let new trees grow. However, some trees may be preserved as shelter for wildlife or riparian buffers. This is a popular reforestation method to regenerate aspen, yellow poplar, white birch, Douglas fir, red and white oak, jack pine, etc.
 
This practice extends beyond the mere selection of tree species and delves into the realm of environmental ethics. While considering which tree species to plant, one inevitably ponders the underlying purpose of the reforestation efforts. For preserving biological diversity, it is important to use local, native species an
