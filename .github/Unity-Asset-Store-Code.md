This is the basic workflow for publishing your assets to the **Asset Store**A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. More info

Publishing to the Unity Asset Store for the first time can be challenging - especially because there is very little information about best practices available. Since we've faced identical issues, we thought it was time to publicly document our experiences since November 2021 - when we first published to the Unity Asset Store. We hope our findings will help you become successful on the Unity Asset Store faster. Good luck!
 
Before you begin, it's important to get into the right mindset: When people use the Asset Store, they are looking for a concrete solution to a concrete problem. After all, they want to save time (to solve their problem).
 
Plus, most people who visit your product page on the Asset Store have never heard of you or your product. Therefore, think about how you can make the onboarding process as smooth as possible for them.
 
**Lesson learned:**You only have a split second to grab their attention. That's why you need an eye-catcher in both your images and your description. An eye-catcher should be a specific piece of information that (visually) stands out from the crowd.
 
When writing the description, remember two things: people are lazy readers - keep the text to a minimum. And: visitors want to know how you can help them solve their problem. Double down on this opportunity!

For more inspiration in creating your product page for the Unity Asset Store, you can visit our Publisher page on the Asset Store. There you will find our assets, which we are constantly trying to improve with new insights and the best practices mentioned in this article.
 
My goal is for people to be able to use the framework to develop their own projects and only be required to release any changes made to the framework back to the community i.e. they should not be required to publish their project's 'content' as open source.
 
GPL/LGPL/AGPL do not trigger the "linking" requirement on artwork, unless the code itself is present in the artwork. Also note that no free license forces people to contribute back their private changes.
 
The GNU LGPL looks like it might be a good fit but seems to have been written with a heavy focus on .dlls and code. Some of this framework will be non-code files (sprites, textures, sounds, etc) that I would like to be covered by the same licence. I am also concerned that anti-DRM clauses may limit adoption.
 
As of version 2.1, the LGPL has been renamed from **Library General Public License** to **Lesser General Public License**. This means you can use it on any work, not just libraries.
 
There is no "one size fits all" license. Your only viable option if you want everything to be licensed the same way is some form of public domain dedication, like CC0 1.0 Universal (which is suitable for everything, despite being part of Creative Commons; however, please note it is only FSF-approved and not OSI-approved).
 
This is why I recommend using two separate licenses if you are going to copyleft: one for code (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, version 3 or later) and one for assets (CC BY 4.0 or CC BY-SA 4.0 depending on use case). If you want to maximize adoption of your framework, your best bet is using the Apache 2 (has a patent grant) or the MIT license for code, and CC BY 4.0 for assets.
 
Just for the record: "copyleft" means that any downstream recipients who distributes adaptations of your framework, is required to offer anyone who receives an adapted work, source code for the adaptation, under the same license (or one with identical terms).
 
That requirement will not be a problem, the separation between "code" and "content" (sometimes called "assets" or data") is well-known, and no copyleft license requires source code of "content" that is simply read by the program to be regarded as part of the adaptation.
 
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. (CC BY-SA 1.0 & 2.0)
 
You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. (CC BY-SA 3.0)
 
The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. (CC BY-4.0)
 
Normally, I would not recommend using a software license for non-code. However, in this case, all the CC licenses are off the chart because they're anti-DRM. The GFDL is copyleft and allows DRM, but it is (IMHO) painful to use because its over-the-top formal requirements. Other content licenses I am aware of (i.e. Open Publication License, Free Art License, Academic Free License) are either non-copyleft, or they are anti-DRM.
 
**LGPLv2.1** and **LGPLv3** are "weak" copyleft licenses that allows downstream recipients to combine your framework with anything, including games that are sold commercially, without giving anything back to the community. The requirement to share adaptions does not trigger until they alter your code and distribute the resulting program. If this is OK, then you should use one of these for the framework (I prefer LGPLv2.1 because I think it is clearer that GPLv3 - but this is a personal preference).
 
**GPLv2** is "normal" copyleft that requires both adapted and linked source code to be shared (if some derived work is distributed). This does not disallow use in commercial games, but the source code of any game that is distributed commercially must be given back to the community. If you want this stronger type of copyleft, then GPLv2 seems to be the right license.
