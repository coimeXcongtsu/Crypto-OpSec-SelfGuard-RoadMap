From a idealistic perspective, and i strongly believe that Tim\Tom shares this personality, leaving the world of ideas and exploration to live in the real world can be a violent transition. That's why this new state is called strangeland because the idealistic can't seem to fit in it.
 
He gets sad because he can't reach this new person that the girl has become. He blames the temptations of the real world, saying that they took his babe away from him in an attemp to convey that fact that she probably just found out some purpose in her existence.
 
Lyrically...one of their more profound songs (bonus track? cmon!!). It sounds like a mental version of hell to me...any place where the "sweetest thoughts get twisted" is a truly terrible place to be. The references to "sand" make it even more pointed.

I think this song is about progressing in a relationship and at first being lost as to where to go and if this feels right, etc. The strangeland represents the stage of the relationship which the lovers have reached.
