So it's pleasant for me to be able to get up with a couple friends four or five nights a week, in a couple of different planes, with close to the same flight plans, enjoying the weather, the scenery, but most of all: shooting the bull with my friends. Pretty much seamlessly. We look at the World Map, figger out where we want to fly from and to, spawn in on active runways (gasp!) or in parking areas, get our acts together, and rotate.

Don't expect much from initial release of XP12 on multi player side. Your best bet is MSFS2020. The developer who was in charge of mobile version of multiplayer left Laminar Research. LR been very quiet on their multi player/MMO plans for desktop side ?
 
That being said, there are also times when I prefer to fly lower and slower, in a smaller group, in non-jets, often below ridges and below/between clouds, enroute between what we hope will be interesting city/field pairs, instead of at FL350.
 
right, so that is an option generally served by AutoATC, VATSIM or IVAO, all have their own clients which also put into the sim other aircraft on their network. Probably the biggest of the MP events is the semi regular vatsim cross the pond which is multisimulator.
 
In the context of XP12, making sure to "shout for" the good things others have done and "shout for" not making the same mistakes is perfectly on topic, if LR dont do it, if enough people want it a 3PD can.

Kinda. there is plenty of discussion added by them on the feedback you linked, but I don't see anyone really having made the case that something is missing now that needs attention. I definitely **DO NOT** want XP12 multiplayer to become a simple checkbox.
 
And more importantly (at least for my online team) can or would XP12 be able to connect to XP11 using the native XP multiplayer functionality?
My (wishful) anticipation is it should work since the whole multiplayer functionality has reportedly not been altered or updated (yet) in XP12.
 
Edit 15 Oct: To answer my own question above, YES native multiplayer works just fine (as it did in XP11) between XP12 users, pretty much without any issues when participating pilots are all using XP12.
 
Thanks for your reply @Rastuasi. Sorry if you don't understand my simple question. You are however completely wrong with your comment that XP 11 native MP 'isn't a thing'. Hundreds of hours between several participants from across the world says otherwise, using XP11 multiplayer without any third party service.
 
Thanks Brett, and yes I know and can confirm MP in XP11 is fully functional and works very well. Having just come off a multiplayer session I can also confirm that XP11 will connect to XP12 MP, however that's it. Connection established but all manner of anomalies were evident regards correct plane recognition and several other things. XP12 to XP12 is just fine, along the same lines as we experienced in XP11, ie. lots of stuff has to be perfectly synchronized between participant systems.
One thing we experienced was with Little NavMap, there are issues there for which I am awaiting feedback from the developer Alex.
 
Btw, the manual on the MP topic is well out of date and full of inaccuracies, both for XP11 and XP12, which at this stage seems just to be a copy of the XP11 manual anyway.
Hopefully when LR addresses the MP update, the XP12 manual will be brought up to speed and corrected.
 
Sure if LAN, it says, and I quote, "Add other simulators on your LOCAL network" so no, across the world is not listed there. Otherwise it would not say "local" as that means within the same house. If it is in fact not just local, then that's a major typo in the system that needs changed.
 
So its not true multiplayer, but peer to peer networking. I would presume multiplayer is when there is a server that xplane connects to, on which you can set up a flight, and everyone else can see and connect to, in a simple interface in Xplane, That is multiplayer, not networking, I guess its a definition of terms. If it was "true multiplayer, people wouldnt be asking for it, and they would not have needed to trial it on mobile.
 
If you go by the X-Plane 11 manual you would go nowhere As I said above the manual is dated and inaccurate. As for connecting via the Internet this works just fine, using the participants IP addresses. I have posted detailed process etc elsewhere in the forums.
 
Semantics as for what is true multiplayer. The object surely is to join together online or on a LAN and fly together, each in their respective planes. My group has been doing this successfully now for as long as XP11 has been around, using the native XP multiplayer features and without any third party platforms, servers or whatever. So no additional overheads, logins, rules to follow etc etc.
Each participating pilot simply connects to the others via the 'Networks' tab in X-Plane and provided several configuration requirements within X-Plane are met, all works pretty darn good. Only barriers are slow internet connections, high latency causes visual issues, and through a VPN connection is a no no.
 
Semantics, its all about the user being able to connect to a server without being an IT genius. For most people that is far to hard, which as I stated, Xplane have added it to Mobile, Im still not sure they have ever in any of there interviews stated that xplane has that capability, just that its coming.
 
Just because someone is too ignorant to use a feature or because it is complex does not mean that it doesnt work or exist. X-Plane is not an i-Phone made for housewives and it isnt Fortnite made for 11 year olds - well, they probably could get X-Plane multiplayer working faster than most folks here, though ?.
 
Understood, the fact that so few people even know it exists. I certainly didnt. Other wise people would not have asked for it for so long. I think it has being one of the most requested features isnt it. ?? Maybe wrong.
 
Well, it says "Network" (between Graphics and Data Output) in the X-Plane GUI and if you click on that there are all sorts of options to get it going. I am not sure how much more obvious and more in the open this can be?
 
Well I guess we have a gazzilion dumb people that cant see, "Multiplayer". Ive never looked there as I dont do networking. If it was so obvious, no one would be asking for it. Its obviously not as obvious to those who are not in the know. Anyway. gone far enough. People know its there if they read this. and than you can expect a ton of complaints on setting it up. But from my understanding you actually have to know someone else with xplane you can fly with, not just click a button, see a list, and choose which group to fly with. Which is what most "users" want.
 
As a non networking X-Plane user I can't help wonder where you get that info from. The many many pilots I have flown and or corresponded with re. flying together, most avoid it because they do not want to fly with unkown just anyone flyers. In fact the opposite, fly with people you know and share your preferences (ie. GA General, Bush Planes, Big Iron etc) is what they are looking for, and without additional rules and requirements encountered on some server driven sign on required groups.
 
Far from it again. Just a few maybe who don't look beyond the end of their nose I suggest. The fact remains that this is no more complex to setup and or to find than how to adjust the graphics settings in order to improve FPS and or display quality.
 
Just in case anyone reading this thread and wants to know more, this is the post I uploaded about 1 year ago, but all is still valid. For XP11 for sure and this far it appears to hold for XP12 multiplayer, given that nothing much has been changed for multiplayer in XP12. Just be aware that trying to connect between XP11 and XP12 is a no-no as it seems that the many internal changes have changed between the XP versions, so data from one to the other causes many anomalies.
