It features the grand silhouette of the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute set against a luminous full moon that bathes the scene in a soft, ethereal light. A gondola with figures can be seen gliding across the calm waters in the foreground, adding a sense of peaceful motion to the composition. The reflection of the moonlight on the water's surface creates a pathway of light leading to the majestic basilica, while the city's lights twinkle faintly in the background. This artwork is a fine example of the romantic and picturesque qualities that many artists sought to depict in their renderings of Venice, a city renowned for its unique beauty and charm.

A completely delightful escape for anyone who has thought about running away, changing their life or taking a chance to fulfil their dream. And under the Venice moonlight . . . how could there not be romance?
 
A week in Venice ignites Margaret Cameron's interest in the private city behind the tourist facade and the obscure tales from its history. Tantalised by stories of this lesser-known Venice she returns the following August for a month-long stay, determined to uncover the Venice of the Venetians.
 
Stepping out from her comfort zone, Margaret finds that friendships - unexpected and spontaneous - blossom within palazzi walls and she makes a discovery: life can lead you along rewarding paths, if you let it.
 
As each day passes, her time in Venice becomes more than just an interlude; soon, the city feels like home. Could she leave her satisfying life in Perth and start anew in Venice? The question becomes urgent when romance waits where she least expected to find it . . .

 
Margaret Cameron grew up in Perth, WA. After training and working as a nurse for many years, she changed course, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Western Australia. Margaret has been writing since her childhood but has only recently started showing her work to others. She was awarded runner-up in the Narrandera Bush Festival Open Writers' Competition (2018) and has had numerous letters and articles published in magazines, including *Vogue Living*. Until the recent pandemic she spent two months of every year in Venice.

Heilmayer was born as the son of the royal court actor and landscape painter Emil Heilmayr. On November 6, 1843, he began his studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in Munich, but broke it off prematurely and continued his education as an autodidac .
 
Heilmayer remained active in Munich and mainly painted fog and moonlight landscapes. In his search for picturesque areas, he went on study trips to Upper Bavaria, Italy and South Tyrol, among others. He also visited Belgium, France and northern Germany.
 
Over the last few years however, there has been a slight shift to host exclusive parties in spectacular palazzos. But we believe that the fun of Carnival is still to be found walking through the calles, past the sweet pasticerias, watching tiny children dressed as unicorns, and elegant Signore in embroidered gowns and feather-plumed hair.
 
The following day (17th) sees a succession of typical Venetian boats make their way along the Grand Canal. All the participants are usually dressed up in traditional or less traditional attire. This along with the fact that the Grand Canal is blocked for vaporettos and private motor boats, it is possible to see a fragment of what Venetians would have experienced one hundred years ago. Over 800 boats participated this year.
 
**Fat Tuesday is the last official day** of Carnival. It is familiarly known all over the world in Catholic countries as the last day before lent where everyone indulges in fatty foods and breaks the rules. One of the most anticipated days of the year.
 
(Note: In theory this breaking of the rules has been justified in the past as a way of suggesting that the rule breakers are in fact those most pious because it shows that they **know** the rules).
