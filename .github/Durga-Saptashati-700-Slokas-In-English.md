Navangam is a method for which nine prayers are recited prior of starting reading the book. Navangam stotrams are: Devi Nyasa, Devi Avahana, Devi Namani, Argala Stotram, Keelaka Stotram, Devi Hrudaya, Dhala, Devi Dhyana and Devi Kavacha.
 
As per the prescribed methods in ancient scriptures, Devi Mahatmya should be read in one sitting. After finishing the recital of Devi Mahatmya, one should chant the Devi Suktam (slokas 7 to 36 of Chapter 8).

The Devi Aparsdha Kshamapan Stotram of 12 verses is chanted after the end of the 13th Chapter of Devi Mahatmyam.
Would like to know when the Kshama Pratana and Uttara Nyasam is to be recited.
Shall greatly appreciate clarification on this.
Thanking you . Regards
 
You believe me or not after doing Saptasati on regular basis my major problems are resolved. You need to believe god you will get solution for every thing there is nothing impossible thing if you believe ma durga .
 
If we recite Durga Saptashati over more than 1 day (e.g. over 3 days, 7 days or 9 days), should the Trayang Mantra be recited on every single day or only on the first day? Similarly, should the Devi Suktam be recited after the paath everyday or only on the last day? I would be really grateful if someone knowledgable person can answer please. Thank you.
 
Chanting the Chandi itself is an inspiration from that Durga Devi. If your heart feels to chant, then do not ignore; it will only do good. Possibly, we men need to be initiated to chant HER glory ?
 
Please pardon my comments since I am not a teacher, by any means. However, as someone who has been joined with the Devi Mahatmyam fro the past 45 years, the text seems to have become my sole existence.
 
In that case, reading anything about HER is offering love, gratitude, affection, and so much else. What rules stand in the way? If She in complete charge, what need to ask for something, even though we feel deeply wounded as part of daily living?
 
What is perception, pain, suffering and joy except a series of thoughts. How and where do thoughts originate, and where do they exert their effects? In the Holy Chandi, She challenges, dvitiiyA kA mamAparA? WHO [ what] is other than ME.

It is often a very bitter pill to swallow, as the pain of life moves us to turn to the Mahatmyam, just as some turn to the leela of Bhagavan in the holy Ramayana or the Srimadbhagavat Purana. For reasons difficult to express, some find the same joy and comfort in reading this Mahatmyam, the leela of Holy Mother.
 
Having such a person do the recitation, and seek some boons, might be a good way, since the power of mantra is being invoked. No longer is one having a loving, casual, constant converstaion with Mother, but one is asking HER to change something for the better, or to receive rewards like wealth.
 
If we have to read Durga Saptsati in more than 1 days (3 or 7 or 9) then how to recite Kawach, Argala, kilak, ratri suktam, devyarthvsirsham ? It is suggested to start Durga Saptsati after reciting Kawach, Argala, kilak, ratri suktam, devyarthvsirsham, do we need to recite these daily?
 
3.Shumbha/ Nishumbha: One more set of demons within us are Shumbha/Nishumbha. Shumbha means doubting oneself and Nishumbha means doubting others. When the mind is clogged with doubt about oneself or others, neither peace nor progress is possible- The army of Shumbha/ Nishumbha consist of following demons :
 
b)Chanda/Munda: Chanda represents an argumentative person, one who opposes everything. Munda, on the other hand, has no reasoning at all. With Chanda and Munda, wrong logic and perception prevail
c)Raktabija: He possesses a unique power. Whenever a drop of his blood falls to earth, another demon of identical size and strength springs up. Raktabija blood represent the overwhelming power of desire. Like a seed, every desire that falls on the fertile soil of our mind grows to maturity and bursts with seeds for the next planting. Every desire produces the seeds of many more, and we find we are never satisfied. Killing of Raktabija represents killing of these tendencies in us.
 
The war between the gods and the demons actually refers to the perpetual conflict between the forces of light and darkness, between righteous and unrighteous urges. Thus there are two opposing psychic forces within all of us, which with the help of a force (you call such force by whatever name according to your religious orientation) beyond our power, we have to over-come
 
i am a non hindi individual but a mother godess worshipper in search of someone who can teach me the right pronounciation and process to attain devi
i am willing to do what ever to learn
i honestly need a true tacher of sri maha vidya.
have been doing durga sapshati with priest for years but he is not interested in sharing
please help
 
That you are aking these questions means that it is the Holy Mother Herself Who is arising as this bhava, this thought. So, SHE would also provide the resources. The same questions you ask began troubling me around 1973, and it was not until 1976 that i was able to find a path. From that time to this, it has been a process of continuous search, but also some joy. Or, rather, a lot of joy, amidst all other tribulations in life, and the sole thing that has kept me alive, and partially able to understand why one has taken brith. Hence, my love for this text is beyond words.
 
What you ask should ideally be communicated to you by some one who has dedicated her/his life to this sadhana. You will find many books on the subject, including one by an Americal swami who makes veryh categorical statements which is not how i was taught. Maybe Mother has given him insights in a particular way, or maybe it is something else.
 
Thanks for the wonderful information.
At Chennai many Mahila Mandali complete the entire Parayanam of Devi Mahatmyam In one sitting on three or four occasions during Navaratri.
The entire Parayanam takes about 4 hours.
Of course practices before and after the main recitation vary according to each group.
This article will help them in future Parayanams.
Maha Periyavaa Saranam.
 
At beginning of Devi Saptashati, detailed procedure of puja with Nyas, Mudra etc given. My question is whether detailed puja before reading is necessary or we can just go with reading as per your procedure. It is so powerful that many people avoid to read in fear of something bad will happen if there is any fault in reading.
 
very nice article.Which stotra should be read before reading saptshati path adhyaya in navratra.Is it necessary to read Trayangam or Navangam mantra on every day before start of 9/10 days parayana .please guide me.Devi aparadh kshamapana stotra should read right after parayana or after siddh kunjika stotra.
 
this is very vital information. I understand from my guru that reciting narayaneeya stuthi 11th chapter for 41 days continuously with lamp lit with ghee will give you the purpose of your prayer. Devi will be always with you,
will protect you from all your worries.
 
Thanks a lot for this post on Navarathri eve. Never knew about Sidha Kunjika Sthothram till now. Seems very important to chant. I am posting in this Sidha Kunjika Sthothram with meaning br P. R. Ramachander Maama for people like me, who did not know. Jaya Jaya Sankara, Hara Hara Sankara! Sri Devyai Namaha!
 
**Prologue:-** The Śrī Devī Mahatmyaṃ, an abstract from Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, is a grand compilation of a war between good and evil, the fight between Goddess Durgā and the demonic asura Mahiṣāsurā. Spiritually, this applies to the removal of all ills, such as lust, greed, anger, laziness, constant wavering of mind, etc. impacting our spiritual ascension. The Śrī Devī Mahatmyaṃ, also called Caṇḍī Pāṭha or Durgā Saptaśati, consists of 700 verses or ślokas, each of which is considered very sacred and has a material and spiritual purpose associated with it. One who recites the entire 700 verses periodically, gains immense happiness and finally gains eligibility and inclination towards self-realization. In total, the Śrī Devī Mahatmyaṃ is an adulation of the Divine Feminine. It is an outpouring of selfless devotion and surrender to the Divine Mother, seen as a representation of the infinite and everlasting energy and bliss.
 
The word kujikā, refers to the One who has the keys to unlock the mystic secrets of the Creation. It is therefore of great and immense value, to recite this stotram on its own and also as a pre-requisite for the sacred 700 verses of Śrī Devī Mahatmyaṃ. A mere recitation is not sufficient, but fully comprehending the meaning and performing the sādhana, will definitely provide fruitful results.
 
There are primarily two variations of the Stotram specified in many books. One of them ends at verse 13 itself. The other goes has an additional śloka. Both versions have been clubbed in this document and the smaller version has been mentioned in square brackets [] at the verses 12 and 13.
 
****Lord Śiva spoke**:-** My dear Devi, Please listen very attentively. The Siddha Kujikā stotram(hymn) is highly revered and considered very auspicious and a pre-requisite for the seven hundred ślokas/hymns of Śrī Durga/Caṇḍī saptaśati as well as the Śrī Caṇḍī mantra japa. The fructification of the 700 hymns becomes possible, only when this stotram is recited prior.
 
Oh my Dear Parvati! Please hide it from your own Creation and do not disclose this most secretive stotram to any undeserving persons. Please be aware that this stotram is extremely effective for annihilation (māraṇaṃ), mesmerization (mohanaṃ), attraction (vaśyaṃ), blocking (stambhanaṃ) and dissension/dispersal (uccāṭana). The Caṇḍī Pāṭha is extremely effective with the recitation of this Siddha Kujikā stotram.
