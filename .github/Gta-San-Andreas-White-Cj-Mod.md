For example, the plate about the Saxon Prinz Friedrich August infantry regiment is on my desk at the moment. It illustrates the the flags carried by the two battalions; uniforms for musketeers, NCOs, sappers, musicians and officers; shako details; rank distinctions; the shabraque for mounted officers; the aforementioned grey-blue surtout; examples of campaign uniform and other details like cartridge cases and forage caps. The plate comes with a page of notes translated into English with a full list of the sources used by Peter B.

Has anyone ever considered painting white trousers using a Foundry Linen base (which is a more yellowy colour, rather than grey? I did for a couple of Victrix Brits I was painting and was rather pleased with the results. Sadly, before you ask, my technical skills do not stretch to either the phoyography or the computery to show you the result!
 
Ive tried something I got out a book I bought and damn me its so simple it works a treat, if u are looking for a warm look to the white (now this is what Ive used before I got my andreas lads) gw white and a very light beige mix 50/50 for the base and then add more white as u go on till u are using the whiet for the highlights, or white and english uniform and same rule applies add white till you are happy gives a colder look, I use it mainly on the horses now, cant waste andreas on old nags
God bless Danilo cartacci, if good enough for him,;) only thing is the book cost me 35
but the eye candy is awesome, he paints the pegaso large figs,

How well does that technique of using hot water and a tooth brush to clean a figure work? And does it work on metal just as well? I know I can get all of an acrylic off if I act fast enough but your figure had ample time to dry thoroughly.
 
The white is interesting. The only downside is that it seems really, really thick. It will take some time to get the hang of cutting it down to a good consistency. I tended to cut it too much to begin with so that it was fine going on as a paint, but separated as it sat on the palate and then dried out really quickly. I love the color though. I could see doing some off white stuff with the 4th highlight really as a small highlight on things, or even being omitted altoghether (using 3 layers from the rest of the set).

MODERN (UPDATED) NOTE as per 2020: This guide is rather outdated as many circumstances have changed in real life in the CDCR prison system, and was a forewarning I do refer broadly to the general conditions of the gang-based political nature inside Californian prisons. These prisons are dominated by racial politics, so in this guide "whites," "blacks," and beyond are used to describe racial groupings. Keep in mind this is of course a very general guide, but this is quite literally how these gangs are structured in real life. I also moved the RP warning and rewrote some of it to better describe IFM's stance on these kinds of groups.
 
**Before anything else, understand one thing - we are portraying white gangmembers, some of which are white supremacists. White gangs in California inherently have a racial aspect due to the nature of historical prison segregation. Before you approach this brand of roleplay, I HIGHLY recommend you leave any actual real life biases at the door, otherwise you will mix IC and OOC and not create a realistic character. Just as an actor portrays a character in a film, we are portraying a character in the context of a videogame. If this sort of thing is uncomfortable, you obviously can entirely avoid this brand of roleplay, but we are trying to mimic a criminal underworld which exists in the penal system of the United States and in the streets of California. "Peckerwood" gangs and skinhead gangs inherently have a very dangerous racial element to them due to the historical context of the locations they spawned in, and on a psychological basis, they use this racial element as a recruitment tool. This means that these characters can be racist and hold extremist fringe views. IF YOU HOLD THESE VIEWS IN REAL LIFE, DO NOT USE THIS AS A PLATFORM TO LIVE OUT YOUR POWER FANTASY. Not only is it inaccurate, you're probably mentally unhealthy, and mixing IC and OOC. There's little point to me listing the numerous reasons that Neo-Nazism or far-right ideologies are bad, if you're a believer in one of those ideologies then you shouldn't be present at this diverse community in the first place.**
 
**At the end of the day, this is a videogame and a hobby - while the nuances of white gangs is exceedingly interesting due to their use of insane outdated racial ideology as a recruitment tool, it is NOT something that should be praised, and you can easily compare these messages to the same sort of recruitment strategies used by groups like ISIS. Far-right terrorism is described by the FBI as one of the most significant domestic terror threats in the United States for GOOD reason. Just like you would portray a ruthless orc in a game of DND, a peckerwood gang member is a VILLAIN.**
 
**AND FINALLY, DON'T BE THAT IDIOT REPLYING "KEEP IT WHITE" or "THAT'S WHITE" TO A FACTION THREAD!!! You're literally spouting racist nonsense on an OOC basis because of characters interacting. You're mixing IC and OOC.**
 
San Andreas, based off of California, is on an in-character basis home to one of the most diverse communities in the United States. While basing our community's efforts on portraying Los Santos as Los Angeles, there's many open opportunities for gang roleplay. However, one part about all California gangs one person should understand is that many of these gangs are part of a large hierarchy that has tentacles stretching down from the highest security prisons in the state. Organizations like the Aryan Brotherhood, Nuestra Familia, Mexican Mafia, and Black Guerrilla Family all have varying degrees of control over street gangs within the state of California. These structures are insidious and organized. Therefore, it is sensible to represent this on an IC basis in our server. This guide is dedicated specifically to white gangsters, so we'll only touch on that branch.
 
White gang-members throughout California can be classified into two branches - peckerwoods and skinheads. Often times there's no distinction, but many white gang-members are not white power skinheads, and many white power skinheads would consider being called a "peckerwood" an insult. Peckerwood is an archaic slur from the South for white-trash poor whites. It has survived to the modern day in referring to any unaffiliated prisoner within some penal systems in the USA, and outlaw biker organizations also use it.
 
As written, there is a clear hierarchical structure within the Californian system. There are independent, unaffiliated "peckerwood" gangs which do their own thing, and then there's specific groups attached to a statewide hierarchy.
 
The Aryan Brotherhood, a prison gang dominant inside of California's Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. I'm not going to go into much detail about who or what they are, but it is roughly equivalent to the Mexican Mafia or Nuestra Familia in terms of structural power. Aryan Brotherhood members are inducted after a long-term prison sentence. Generally, their members are one of two things or a combination of the two things - hyperintelligence and ruthlessness. You can be very intelligent and make it to the top by ordering other people to do your dirty work and outsmarting competitors, or you can just kill your competitors. Or you can do both. That's how people make their bones and get into the Aryan Brotherhood. They run everything in prison, and therefore most white gangs or motorcycle clubs pa
