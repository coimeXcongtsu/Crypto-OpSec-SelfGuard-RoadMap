Ok so just the other day I received a lovely advertising package for a new condo high rise with the most horrible flattened hexagon shaped island- for a cool 3million plus. I died. Maybe is just a show kitchen. I cannot bear to even post the plan because so much of it is beautiful- but the flat hex island is no bueno. I know sometimes it is necessary to cut a corner here and there and we have done it too- but is a top thing to avoid when you can do so- and always with a light hand. Think curvier than chamfered when possible and **remember just how many laps you will do** around an island like this and your hip bones will thank you too!
 
Just today heard a few people commenting on this and was a bit surprised that so many thought this was an ok idea. That is ok- but there is no good reason I can see to do this at least in the typical manner of a straight run going higher to just vary it for no real reason. Sure mid level cabinets full height can be cool and done well by good designers but the idea below is a big NO in my book. **This came about from big box retailers trying to easily make their non custom cabinetry look custom.** They are not fooling anyone.
 
Oh lordy this one I see a lot and is an **absolute no way in hell**. Going above the hood with NO kill point is bad news. Tile transitions are a huge issue for us in any application and is one of the easy things to overlook for a diy-er or a novice designer. Heck it took me many years to hone these skills but just recently in Destin, we had cabinets taken out and redone because the plan was not followed and the tile ran short of the edge of the countertop. This is serious business for my team.
 
Ventilation is key to removing toxins and grease from your kitchen. **It is not healthy to have a non ventilated kitchen. Period.** Unless your idea of cooking is calling for take out! The best ventilation is an updraft with an internal, inline or remote blower. Be careful on the coast as remote blowers can have a lot of rust quickly and if that flapper gets stuck and your home is cold and the air outside is hot- well, lets just say you may think you have a faucet running from your hood! Condensation can be a big deal. Been there done that!

This is a huge element of design in my opinion and am again shocked at how many beautiful kitchens are ruined by a lack of communication between designer ( or contractor/homeowner if no designer) and the various trades who execute a kitchen- and their must be communication or the project is doomed from the start. Often the contractor is too busy to pay attention to these sorts of problems and they can ruin a beautiful project.**These examples below are from just typical remodels showing tile transitions and terminations gone very very wrong- but even on a budget,** there is no reason why these mistakes must be made!
 
Microwave drawers are great- they pull out. We have done many times. **But putting a microwave with a door hinging is not wise under a countertop- if no else to place- call me**. I can help reconfigure the kitchen to make it work. It just is too much bending to lift out or even look inside-and not ergonomic at all. I can see doing this in an ADA kitchen if dedicated to that person. But that is it. And before anyone says oh but you are not worried about bending with dishwashers- there are also dish drawers for those who have a need to limit bending- one on each side of sink right under counter will work great!
 
What else is a serious NO WAY to you? I want to hear what you have learned! This old dog can always learn new tricks! I have a few more but some are more design aesthetic than an absolute. Now on to bathrooms!
 
The Kitchen also underwent a semi-reconfiguration of layout. We removed a wall that separated the kitchen from dining and created a fully open space. Which left us with the decision, use both spaces as one massive kitchen or make the dining feel independent, but connected and cohesive. We opted for independent but cohesive. Again a massive kitchen in a 114 year old home felt wrong, but the open flow still allowed for us to extend the kitchen footprint slightly, makes it feel larger and more roomy, without removing the charm of the formal dining space. Note: the view below will look a bit different (millwork, mantel color, sconces, chandelier, furniture etc. will be added/changed).
 
These kitchen renderings and space plan have been wildly helpful in helping finalize decisions with color, floor-plan. I cannot say enough good things about having them and our experience creating them with Unique Kitchen and Baths! This is not sponsored in any way but have been so happy with the process and wanted to share the resource we utilized for renderings.
 
I am creating a new kitchen for my tiny family house and have prepared a 3D prototype. The design includes several modules. Rhino 8 has been great for quickly rendering the views, allowing me to present the prototype to the contractor.

oh maybe i was speaking to specifically. its more of a finished edge that sticks out a little bit. we ordered enough to go around the windows, cut them in half so that the finished edges are on the counter side. does that make more sense? I think i need to edit that as it might not make sense. haha. sorry.
 
I could clearly see the love and efforts you guys put in building this kitchen and it is all worth it in the end! It is so beautiful and full of love. I loved how the wood cabinets are giving it a complete look.
 
Beautiful!
Can you tell us about the thought process of no toe kicks under the counters? It looks great and sleek (form) but the practicality of leaning a bit over the counters and sink (function) seems tiring.
 
Looks amazing.
Small request for future posts that include floor plans: please, please stick to standard and orient them to North. It makes them much easier to mentally picture a home with how the sun moves across the space.
 
Did you have to do any reinforcing of the island to bear the weight of the marble countertop? We are building a house right now and I would love a repurposed piece of furniture but was not sure it could withstand the weight.
Thank you!
 
I meant to add: that tile is just so beautiful! Since we have a small galley kitchen and a small shower, I was able to find enough tile for each in the Pratt and Larson back room for a small fraction of the regular price. Then I went back and found tile for our fireplace. That back room is dangerous!
 
They are available in multiple sizes, with more than 1,000 colors and finishes, and options to choose your oven door type, burner configuration, and cooktop add-ons such as a griddle or charbroil grill.
 
The lower cabinets are natural red birch. These are actually the exact cabinets we had in our previous home! I can attest that they still looked brand new when we sold the house, after over 15 years of use!
 
Note: The inset doors are generally not recommended for coastal or other areas with high humidity, because the doors can expand and rub. I have not had a huge issue with this. The doors are individually adjustable.
 
I worked with a local design center, Crestwood Kitchens and Bath, to come up with the exact design specifications. My designer helped turn my vision into reality and provided a lot of practical advice. This design assistance was provided for free with the purchase of our cabinets.
 
I chose to place Bluebelle in the island so that the cook can enjoy the view! On the right of Bluebelle there are drawers, and on the left a top drawer with a cabinet below. The cabinet has pullout drawers in it. These are the kind of details that the kitchen designer helped me with.
 
Inside, the cabinet has three fixed shelves on top, and pullout shelving below to hold plenty of pantry goods. It also houses the microwave out of view. Again, these are details that kitchen designer helped me with.
 
Due to a last minute snafu, I had to find something different that was available for immediate delivery. This mixup was stressful at the time, but sometimes things happen for a reason. I actually prefer this material, with its faint marble veining, to the solid white I had originally selected.
 
Choosing a Bosch dishwasher was a no-brainer for me. We had a Bosch in our previous home, and I think they are the best. They are whisper-silent, so you are not bothered by the noise if you have an open floor plan, as we do.
 
The functionality of the faucet is good, but I might choose a different, more traditional style now. And I would definitely prefer an antique/natural brass finish instead of the burnished brass we have. It is still a beautiful faucet, though!
