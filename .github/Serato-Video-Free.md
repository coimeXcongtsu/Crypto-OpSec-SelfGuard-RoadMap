If you want to do this (with both applications running on the same computer) then you **could** (there are more options I'm sure)] take a stereo feed from a output on your DJ mixer (Tape Out/headphone Out) and plug it into your Audio Interface. Then Set up an Audio Track within Logic and set its input to which ever inputs you have used on your interface.
 
No need for soundflower as Serato has its own audio interface. The biggest question would be what Mac you're using? Anything 2007 on should be up to the task but you should mention what you're running this on to make sure you have enough ram & HD speed to not have dropouts or affect Serato's performance.

you should be able to just switch your audio preferences in logic to have your SL box as the input, create an audio track and record. I've been doing it like that to record records into logic so I'd imagine it would work for a set as well, just make sure you're getting the master out mix from serato..
